Special Thanks To:
A vast work like the AD&D° Znd Edition
game doesn't spring into being from nothing. Especially not in this
case, since this is the 2nd Edition of the game. The ADkD game
owes its existence the efforts of many people.
The AD&D game probably never would have existed without the
work of Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson. Together they introduced
the world to the concept of role-playing games. Their efforts
resulted in the DUNGEONS k DRAGONSQ game, forerunner of
the AD&D system. Gary Gygax then went on to be the principal
creator and guiding force of the A.Dl:D rules. His particular vision
set the standards for what the ADVANCED DUNGEONS It
DRAGONS" game was—and what it wasn't.
A game such as the AD&D game, or any role-playing garne, is
much more than the work of just one man. Many others have writ-
ten ru.le books, contributed ideas. playtested, criticized, and added
their own personal interpretations of what the game is. For their
efforts. they too deserve credit. New rule books were written by
David "Zeb" Cook (Oriental Adventures), Jeff Grubb (Manual of
the Planes), Tracy Hickman (DRAGONLANCEP Adventures), Kim
Mohan (Wilderness Survival Guide), Douglas Niles (Dungeoneefs
Survival Guide), Jim Ward (Legends and Lore. GREYHAWIO‘
Adventures), and Margaret Weis (DRAGONLANCE? Adven-
tures).
Over the years, there have been many people who have written
rules, edited manuscripts, offered suggestions, and playtested. With
an undertaking as large as the AD&D game, this list is long, but
each of these people deserves mention for his or her efforts. While
there is not enough space to mention exactly what each person did,
each has been important to the development of the game. Mark
Acres, Peter Aronson, Jim Bambra, Brian Blume, Mike Breaull.
Mike Carr, Sean Cleary, Troy Denning, Michael Dobson, Jean-
Louis Fiasson, Joe Fischer, Ed Greenwood, Ernie Gygax, Luke
Gygax, Mary Gygax, Allen Hammack, Neal Healey. Kevin Hen-
dryx, J. Eric Holmes, Tom I-lolsinger, Jake Jaquet, Harold Johnson,

Lucion, Francois Marcela-Froideval, Steve Marsh, Dave Megarry,

nis Sustare, Dave Sutherland, Dave Trampier, Don Tumbull, Jack
Vance, Jean Wells, Tom Wham, Mike Williams, Skip Williams, and
Steve Winter all deserve a share of the credit.
Even so, the list of those to thank is not complete. lt can never be
complete. The AD&D game is continually evolving—each player
and each DM adds his own touch to the whole. No list of special
thanks can be complete without recognizing the most important
contributors of all—the millions of players who, over the years,
have made the ADkD game what it is today.

Foreword to the Second Edition
It has been a long time getting here. I don't mean the months, perhaps even years, you may
have waited for a revised, expanded, and improved 2nd Edition of the AD&D® game. I mean
the long time it has taken me to reach this point, the writing of the foreword. Forewords are
written last, so that you can summarize your feelings and experiences about the book you have
written.
It's not accurate to say this is a book that I alone have written. First off, there are a lot of
other names listed in the credits. They, especially the editors, contributed time and talents that I
don't have. Improving the organization and readability was one of the reasons we started this
project in the first place. These are tasks that can't be done without talented editors who play
and care about the game. If you discover that it's easier to find rules during your gaming
sessions and that everything seems to make more sense, thank the editors.
Even with the editors, this is not our work alone. None of this would ever have come into
being without interested and involved players. The people who really decided what needed to be
done for the 2nd Edition are the players who mailed in questions, everyone who wrote an article
for DRAGON® Magazine, and everyone who button-holed me (or other designers) at
conventions. These were the people who decided what needed to be done, what needed fixing,
what was unclear, and what they just didn't like. I didn't sit in a vacuum and make these
decisions. As the designer and developer, I had to make the final choice, but those choices were
based on your input. And your input is the most valuable asset we have going.
So how do I feel‘! Excited, exhausted, relieved, and nervous—all at once. It's a great bag of
emotions. I'm excited to see this book come out. I've spent more time on this than I have on any
other single work I've done. That leads to exhaustion. The 2nd Edition has demanded and
received hours upon months of attention. Now that it is finally coming out, the feeling of relief
is beginning to set in. There were times when the task looked impossible, when it seemed it
would never end, or when everything was going wrong. Only now, when it's in the final stages
of polishing, am I beginning to realize that it really is done. And of course there is nervousness.
The AD&D game is the granddaddy of all role-playing games. You've made it perfectly clear
that you liked the first edition of the AD&D game, even with all its warts. I liked (and still like)
it. So, now with the arrival of Znd Edition, of course I'm nervous.
None of this comes as any surprise. I volunteered to prepare the 2nd Edition because I wanted
to do something for the game I liked. The ten years of experience I've had in game design has
shown me what works and what doesn't and sometimes even why. At the very start, we
outlined the goals: to make it easier to find things, to make the rules easier to understand, to fix
the things that did not work, to add the best new ideas from the expansions and other sources,
and, most important of all, to make sure the game was still the one you knew and enjoyed. Of
them all, the last was the hardest and most demanding, conflicting as it did with my basic desire
to design things. Fortunately, things didn't rest on me alone. Lots of eager eyes, from those of
fellow designers to those of enthusiastic playtesters, minutely examined this book and restrained
me from overzealousness. It hasn't always been easy to walk the tine line between "not enough"
and “too much."
In the past two years, I've talked to interested players many times, hearing their concerns and
sharing my ideas. It was at the end of one of these talks (at a convention in Missoula, Montana),
just as I described some rules change, that one of the listeners smiled and said, "You know,
we've been doing that for years." And that is what the 2nd Edition is all about—collecting and
organizing all those things that we, as players, have been doing for years.

You are reading the key to the most exciting
hobby in the world—role-playing games.
These first few pages will introduce you
to the second edition of the most successful
role-playing game ever published. If you are
a novice role-player, stop right here and
read the section labeled The Real Basics (on
the next page). When you understand what
role-playing and the AD&D° game are all
about, come back to this point and read the
rest of the introduction. lf you are an experi-
enced role-player, skip The Real Basics.
Why a Second Edition?
Before answering
that question, let's define what the second
edition of the AD&D game is and is not.
This second edition of the AD&D game is
a lot different from the first edition. The
presentation of the game has been cleaned
up. The rules are reorganized, clariﬁed, and
streamlined. Where necessary, things that
didn't work have been fixed. Things that did
work haven't been changed.
The second edition of the AD!:D game is
not a statement of what any one person
thinks the game should be. lt is the result of
more than three years of discussion,
thought, consultation, review, and play-
testing.
Now to the question of "Why a second
edition?" The AD&D game evolved over
the course of 16 years. During that time, the
game grew tremendously through play.
Changes and improvements (and a few mis-
takes) were made. These were published in
subsequent volumes. By 1988, the game
consisted of 12 hardcover rule books. lt was
physically and intellectually unwieldy (but
still a lot of fun). The time was right to reor-
ganize and recombine all that information
into a manageable package. That package is
the second edition.
How the Rule Books
are Organized
The AD&D game
rule books are intended primarily as refer-
ence books. They are designed so any spe-
ciﬁc rule can be found quickly and easily
during a game.
Everything a player needs to know is in
the Player's Handbook. That's not to say
that all the rules are in this book. But every
nile that a player needs to know in order to
play the game is in this book.
A few mles have been reserved for the
Dungeon Master's Guide (DMG). These
either cover situations that very seldom
arise or give the Dungeon Master (DM)
information that players should not have
beforehand. Everything else in the DMG is
information that only the Dungeon Master
needs. If the DM feels that players need to
know something that is explained in the
DMG, he will tell them.
Like the DMG. the Monstrous Compen-
dium is the province of the DM. This gives
complete and detailed information about
the monsters, people, and other creatures
inhabiting the AD&D world. Some DMs
don't mind if players read this information,
but the game is more fun if players don't
know everything about their foes—it
heightens the sense of discovery and danger
of the unknown.
Learning the Game
lf you have played
the ADkD game before, you know almost
everything you need to play the second edi-
tion. We advise you to read the entire Play-
er's Handbook, but the biggest changes are
in these chapters: Character Classes, Com-
bat, and Experience. Be sure to read at least
those three chapters before sitting down to
play.
lf you come to a term you do not under-
stand, look for it in the Glossary, which
begins on page 11.
If you have never played the AD&D
game before, the best way to learn to play
the game is to find a group of experienced
players and ioin them. They can get you
immediately into the game and explain
things as you need to know them. You don't
need to read anything beforehand. ln fact,
it's best if you can play the game for several
hours with experienced players before read-
ing any of the niles. One of the truly mar-
velous things about a role-playing game is
that even though the concept is difficult to
explain, it is simple to demonstrate.
If none of you.r friends are involved in a
game, the best place to find experienced
players is through your local hobby store.
Role-playing and general gaming clubs are
common and are always eager to accept
new members. Many hobby stores of-fer a
bulletin board through which DMs can
advertise for new players and new players
can ask for information about new or ongo-
ing games. lf there is no hobby store in your
area, check at the local library or school.
if you can't find anyone else who knows
the ADkD game, you can teach yourself.
Read the Player's Handbook and create
some characters. Try to create a variety of
character classes. Then pick up a pre-
packaged adventure module for low-level
characters, round up two or three friends,
and dive into it. You probably will make lots
of mistakes and wonder constantly whether
you are doing everything wrong. Even if
you are, don't worry about it. The AD&D
game is big, but eventually you'll bring it
under control.
Welcome to the Second Edition AD8.D“ Game
The Second Edltlon
AD&D Game l.lne
Quite a few books
and other products are published for the
AD&D game. As a player, you need only
one of them—this book. Every player and
DM should have a copy of the Player's
Handbook. Everything else is either option-
al or intended for the Dungeon Master.
The Dungeon Masters Guide is essential
for the DM and it is for the DM only. Play-
ers who are not themselves DMs have no
cause to read the DMC.
The Monstrous Compendium is not one,
but several products. The book can be
expanded whenever new compendiums are
released. The first pack of monsters is essen-
tial to the game. It includes the rnost corn-
monly encountered monsters, mythical
beasts. and legendary creatures. Additional
packs expand on these monsters and give
the game more variety. Specialty
compendiums—those for Greyhawk, the
Forgotten Realms, Kara-Tur, etc.—are high-
ly recommended for DMs who play in those
settings.
Expanded character class books-The
Complete Fighter, The Complete Thief,
etc.-—provide a lot more detail on these
character classes than does the Player's
Handbook. These books are entirely
optional. They are for those players who
really want a world of choice for their char-
acters.
Adventure modules contain complete
game adventures. These are especially use-
ful for DMs who aren't sure how to create
their own adventures and for DMs who
need an adventure quickly and don't have
time to write one of their own.
A Note About Pronouns
The male pronoun
(he, him, his) is used exclusively throughout
the second edition of the AD&D game rules.
We hope this won't be construed by anyone
to be an attempt to exclude females from the
game or imply their exclusion. Centuries of
use have neutered the male pronoun. ln
written material it is clear. concise, and
familiar. Nothing else is.
Creating a Character
To create a charac-
ter to play in the AD&D game, proceed, in
order, through Chapters 1 through 6.
(Chapter 5 is optional). These chapters will
tell you how to generate your character's
ability scores, race, and class, decide on his
alignment, pick proficiencies, and buy
equipment. Once you have done all this,
your character is ready for adventurel



The Real Basics
This section is intended for novice role-
players. If you have played role-playing
games before, don't be surprised if what you
read here sounds familiar.
Games come in a wide assortment of
types: board games, card games, word
games, picture games, miniatures games.
Even within these categories are subcatego-
ries. Board games, for example, can be
divided into path games, real estate games.
military simulation games, abstract strategy
games, mystery games, and a host of others.
Still, in all this mass of games, role
playing games are unique. They form a cat-
egory all their own that doesn't overlap any
other category.
For that reason, role-playing games are
hard to describe. Comparisons don't work
because there isn't anything similar to com-
pare them to. At least, not without stretch-
ing your imagination well beyond its
normal, everyday extension.
But then, stretching your imagination is
what role-playing is all about. So let's try an
analogy.
Imagine that you are playing a simple
board game, called Snakes and Ladders.
Your goal is to get from the bottom to the
top of the board before all the other players.
Along the way are traps that can send you
sliding hack toward your starting position.
There are also ladders that can let you jump
ahead. closer to the finish space. So far, it's
pretty simple and pretty standard.
Now let's change a few things. instead of
a flat, featureless board with a path winding
from side to side, let's have a maze. You are
rtanding at the entrance, and you know that
there's an exit somewhere, but you don't
know where. You have to find it.
instead of snakes and ladders, we'll put in
rtidden doors and secret passages. Don't roll
r die to see how far you move; you can
"nove as far as you want. Move down the
:orridor to the intersection. You can tum
'ight, or left, or go straight ahead, or go
Jack the way you came. Or, as long as
you're here, you can look for a hidden door.
.f you find one, it will open into another
stretch of corridor. That corridor might take
Iou straight to the exit or lead you into a
ilind alley. The only way to find out is to
FIG]? in and start walking.
Of course, given enough time, eventually
/ou'll find the exit. To keep the game inter-
sting, let's put some other things in the
naze with you. Nasty things. Things like
rampire bats and hobgobliris and zombies
ind ogres. Of course, we'll give you a sword
ind a shield, so if you meet one of these
hings you can defend yourself. You do
Lnow how to use a sword, don't you"!
And there are other players in the maze as
vell. They have swords and shields, too.
‘low do you suppose another player would
eact if you chance to meet? He might
ittack, but he also might offer to team up.
After all, even an ogre might think twice
about attacking two people carrying sharp
swords and stout shields.
Finally, let's put the board somewhere
you can't see it. Let's give it to one of the
players and make that player the referee.
Instead of looking at the board, you listen to
the referee as he describes what you can see
from your position on the board. You tell
the referee what you want to do and he
moves your piece accordingly. As the ref-
eree describes your surroundings, try to pic-
ture them mentally. Close your eyes and
construct the walls of the maze around
yourself. Imagine the hobgoblin as the ref-
eree describes it whooping and gamboling
down the corridor toward you. Now imag-
ine how you would react in that situation
and tell the referee what you are going to do
about it.
We have just constructed a simple role-
playing game. lt is not a sophisticated game,
but it has the essential element that makes a
role-playing game: The player is placed in
the midst of an unknown or dangerous situ-
ation created by a referee and must work his
way through it.
This is the heart of role-playing. The
player adopts the role of a character and
then guides that character through an
adventure. The player makes decisions,
interacts with other characters and players,
and, essentially, "pretends" to be his charac-
ter during the course of the game. That
doesn't mean that the player must jump up
and down, dash around, and act like his
character. lt means that whenever the char-
acter is called on to do something or make a
decision, the player pretends that he is in
that situation and chooses an appropriate
course of action.
Physically. the players and referee (the
DM) should be seated comfortably around a
table with the referee at the head. Players
need plenty of room for papers, pencils,
dice, rule books, drinks, and snacks. The
referee needs extra space for his maps, dice,
rule books, and assorted notes.
The Goal
Another major dif-
ference between role-playing games and
other games is the ultimate goal. Everyone
assumes that a game must have a beginning
and an end and that the end comes when
someone wins. That doesn't apply to role-
playing because no one "wins" in a role-
playing game. The point of playing is not to
win but to have fun and to socialize.
An adventure usually has a goal of some
sort: protect the villagers from the mon-
sters; rescue the lost princess; explore the
ancient niins. Typically, this goal can be
attained in a reasonable playing time: four
to eight hours is standard. This might
require the players to get together for one,
9
two, or even three playing sessions to reach
their goal and complete the adventure.
But the game doesn't end when an adven-
ture is ﬁnished. The same characters can go
on to new adventures. Such a series of
adventures is called a campaign.
Remember, the point of an adventure is
not to win but to have fun while working
toward a common goal. But the length of
any particular adventure need not impose
an artificial limit on the length of the game.
The AD&rD° game embraces more than
enough adventure to keep a group of char-
acters occupied for years.
Required Materials
Aside from a copy
of this book, very little is needed to play the
AD&D game.
You will need some sort of character
record. TSR publishes character record
sheets that are quite handy and easy to use,
but any sheet of paper will do. Blank paper,
lined paper, or even graph paper can be
used. A double-sized sheet of paper (11 X 17
inchm). folded in half, is excellent. Keep
your character record in pencil, because it
will change frequently during the game. A
good eraser is also a must.
A full set of polyhedral dice is necessary.
A full set consists of 4-, &, 8-, 10-, 12-, and
20-sided dice. A few extra 6- and lﬂdsided
dice are a good idea. Polyhedral dice should
be available wherever you got this book.
Throughout these rules, the varlous dice
are referred to by I code that is in the form:
I of dice, followed by "d," followed by a
numeral for the type of dice. ln other
words, if you are to roll one Mided die, you
would see "roll 1d6.” Five 12-sided dice are
referred to as "5d12." (U you don't have ﬂve
12-sided dice, just roll one five times and
add the results.)
When the rules say to roll "percentile
dice” or "1d100," you need to generate a
random number from 1 to 100. One way to
do this is to roll two 10-sided dice of differ-
ent colors. Before you roll. designate one
die as the tens place and the other as the
ones place. Rolling them together enables
you to generate a number from 1 to 100 (a
result of "0" on both dice is read as “O0” or
"100/’). For example, if the blue die (repre-
senting the tens place) rolls an "8" and the
red die (ones place) rolls a "5," the result is
85. Another, more expensive, way to gener-
ate a number from 1 to 100 is to buy one of
the dice that actually have numbers from I
to 100 on them.
At least one player should have a few
sheets of graph paper for mapping the
group's progress. Assorted pieces of scratch
paper are handy for making quick notes, for
passing secret messages to other players or
the DM, or for keeping track of odd bits of
information that you don't want cluttering



up your character record.
Miniature figures are handy for keeping
track of where everyone is in a confusing sit-
uation like a battle. These can be as elabo-
rate or simple as you like. Some players use
miniature lead or pewter ﬁgures painted to
resemble their characters. Plastic soldiers,
chess pieces, boardgarne pawns, dice, or
bits of paper can work just as well.
An Example of Play
To further clarify
what really goes on during an ADkD@
game, read the following example. This is
typical of the sort of action that occurs dur-
ing a playing session.
Shortly before this example begins. three
player characters fought a skirmish with a
wererat (a creature similar to a werewolf
but which becomes an enormous rat instead
of a wolf). The wererat was wounded and
ﬂed down a tunnel. The characters are in
pursuit. The group includes two fighters
and a deric. Fighter 1 is the group's leader.
DM: You've been following this tunnel for
about 120 yards. The water on the ﬂoor
is ankle deep and very cold. Now and
then you feel something brush against
your foot. The smell of decay is getting
stronger. The tunnel is gradually ﬁlling
with a cold mist.
Fighter 1: l don't like this at all. Can we see
anything up ahead that looks like a door-
way, or a branch in the tunnel‘!
DM: Within the range of your torchlight,
the tunnel is more or less straight. You
don't see any branches or doorways.
Cleric: The wererat we hit had to come this
way. There's nowhere else to go.
Fighter 1: Unless we missed a hidden door
along the way. l hate this place; it gives
me the creeps.
Fighter 2: We have to track down that were-
rat. lsay we keep going.
Fighter 1: OK. We keep moving down the
tunnel. But keep your eyes open for any-
thing that might be a door.
DM: Another 30 or 35 yards down the tun-
nel, you find a stone block on the ﬂoor.
Fighter 1: A block? l take a closer look.
DM: lt's a cut block, about 12 by 16 inches,
and 18 inches or so high. lt looks like a
different kind of rock than the rest of the
tunnel.
Fighter 2: Where is it? ls it in the center of
the tunnel or off to the side?
DM: lt's right up against the side.
Fighter 1: Can I move it?
DM (checking the character's Strength
score): Yeah, you can push it around
without too much trouble.
Fighter 1: Hmmm. This is obviously a
marker of some sort. l want to check this
area for secret doors. Spread out and
examine the walls.
DM (rolls several dice behind his rule book,
where players can't see the results):
Nobody finds anything unusual along
the walls.
Fighter 1: lt has to be here somewhere.
What about the ceiling?
DM: You can't reach the ceiling. lt's about a
foot beyond your reach.
Cleric: Of course! That block isn't a marker.
it's a step. l climb up on the block and
start prodding the ceiling.
DM (rolling a few more dice): You poke
around for 20 seconds or so, then sud-
denly part of the tunnel roof shifts.
You've found a panel that lifts away.
Fighter 1: Open it very carefully.
Cleric: l pop it up a few inches and push it
aside slowly. Can l see anything?
DM: Your head is still below the level of the
opening, but you see some dim light
from one side.
Fighter 1: We boost him up so he can get a
better look.
DM: OK, your friends boost you up into the
room . . .
Fighter 1: No, not We boost him just high
enough to get his head through the open-
ing.
DM: OK, you boost him up a foot. The two
of you are each holding one of his legs.
Cleric, you see another tunnel, pretty
much like the one you were in, but it
only goes off in one direction. There's a
doorway about 10 yards away with a
soft light inside. A line of muddy
pawprints leads from the hole you're in
to the doorway.
Cleric: Fine. l want the ﬁghters to go first.
DM: As they're lowering you back to the
block, everyone hears some grunts,
splashing, and clanking weapons coming
from further down the lower tunnel.
They seem to be closing fast.
Cleric: Upl Upl Push me back up through
the holel l grab the ledge and haul myself
up. l'll help pull the next guy up.
(All three characters scramble up through
the hole.)
DM: What about the panel?
Fighter 1: We push it back into place.
DM: It slides back into its slot with a nice,
loud “clunk.” The grunting from below
gets a lot louder.
Fighter 1: Great, they heard it. Cleric, get
over here and stand on this panel. We're
going to check out that doorway.
DM: Cleric, you hear some shouting and
shufﬂing around below you, then there's
a thump and the panel you're standing
on lurches.
Cleric: They're trying to batter it open!
DM (to the fighters): When you peer around
the doorway, you see a small, dirty room
with a small cot, a table, and a couple of
stools. On the cot is a wererat curled up
into a ball. lts back is toward you.
There's anot.her door in the far wall and a
10
The Real Basics
small gong in the comer.
Fighter 1: ls the wererat moving?
DM: Not a bit. Cleric, the panel just
thumped again. You can see a little crack
in it now.
Cleric: Do something quick, you guys.
When this panel starts coming apart, I'm
getting off it.
Fighter 1: OK alreadyl l step into the room
and prod the wererat with my shield.
What happens‘!
DM: Nothing. You see blood on the cot.
Fighter 1: ls this the same wererat we fought
before?
DM: Who knows? All wererats look the
same to you. Cleric, the panel thumps
again. That crack is looking really big.
Cleric: That's it. I get off the panel. l'm mov-
ing into the room with everybody else.
DM: There's a tremendous smash and you
hear chunks of rock banging around out
in the corridor. followed by lots of snarl-
ing and squeaking. You see ﬂashes of
torchlight and wererat shadows through
the doorway.
Fighter 1: All right, the other fighter and l
move up to block the doonuay. That's
the narrowest area, they can only come
through it one or two at a time. Cleric,
you stay in the room and be ready with
your spells.
Fighter 2: At last, a decent. stand—up fight!
DM: As the first wererat appears in the
doorway with a spear in his paws, you
hear a slam behind you.
Cleric: l spin around. What is it‘?
DM: The door in the back of the room is
broken off its hinges. Standing in the
doorway, holding a mace in each paw, is
the biggest, ugliest wererat you've ever
seen. A couple more pairs of red eyes are
shining through the darkness behind
him. He's licking his chops in a way that
you find very unsettling.
Cleric: Aaaaarrrghl l saeam the name of
my deity at the top of my lun§ and then
ﬂip over the cot with the dead wererat on
it so the body lands in front of him. l've
got to have some help here, guys.
Fighter 1 (to fighter 2): Help him, I'll handle
this end of the room. (To DM): l'm
attacking the wererat in the doorway.
DM: While fighter Z is switching positions,
the big wererat looks at the body on the
floor and his jaw drops. He looks back
up and says, "That's lgnatz. He was my
brother. You killed my brother." Then he
raises both maces and leaps at you.
At this point a ferocious melee breaks
out. The DM uses the combat niles to play
out the battle. lf the characters survive, they
can continue on whatever course they
choose.



Ability-any of the six natural traits that rep-
resent the basic definition of a player char-
acter; Strength, Dexterity, Constitution,
Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. A
player character's abilities are determined at
the beginning of a game by rolling 6-sided
dice (d6s). The scores continue to be used
throughout the game as a means of deter-
mining success or failure of many actions.
Ability check - a 1d20 roll against one of
your character‘s ability scores (modiﬁers
may be added to or subtracted from the die
roll). A result that is equal to or less than
your character's ability score indicates that
the attempted action succeeds.
AC - abbreviation for Armor Class (q.v.).
Alignment - a factor in defining a player
character that reflects his basic attitude to-
ward society and the forces of the universe.
Basically there are nine categories demon-
strating the character's relationship to order
vs. chaos and good vs. evil. A player char-
acter's alignment is selected by the player
when the character is created.
Area of effect - the area in which a magical
spell or a breath weapon works on any crea-
tures unless they make a saving throw.
Armor Class (abbr. AC) - a rating for the
protective value of a type of armor, figured
from 10 (no armor at all) to 0 or even -10
(the best magical armor). The higher the
AC, the more vulnerable the character is to
attack.
Attack roll - The 1d20 roll used to determine
if an attack is successful.
Bend bars/lift gates roll - the roll of percen-
tile dice to determine whether a character
succeeds in bending metal bars, lifting a
heavy portcullis, or similar task. The result
needed is a function of Strength and can be
found in Table 1.
Bonus spells - extra spells at various spell
levels that a priest is entitled to because of
high Wisdom; shown in Table 5.
Breath weapon - the ability of a dragon or
other creature to spew a substance out of its
mouth just by breathing, without making
an attack roll. Those in the area of effect
must roll a saving throw.
Cha - abbreviation for Charisma (q.v.).

Chapter |= Player Character Ability Scores
To venture into the worlds of the AD8xD"
game. you first need to create a character.
The character you create is your alter ego in
the fantasy realms of this game, a make-
believe person who is under your control
and through whom you vicariously explore
the world the Dungeon Master (DM) has
created.
Each character in the AD&D game has six
abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution,
intelligence, Wisdom. and Charisma. The
first three abilities represent the physical na-
ture of the character, while the second three
quantify his mental and personality traits.
ln various plaos throuﬂtout these rules,
the following abbreviatiom are used for
the ability names: 5trength—Str;
Duterity—DeX; Constitution—Con; in-
telligence—lnt; W'udcrm—Wis; Charisma
-—Cha.
Rolling Ability Scores
Let‘s first see how
to generate ability scores for your character,
after which deﬁnitions of each ability will
be given.
The six ability scores are determined ran-
domly by rolling six-sided dice to obtain a
score from 3 to 15. There are several meth-
ods for rolling up these scores.
0 Method I: Roll three six-sided dice (3d6);
the total shown on the dice is your charac-
ter's Strength ability score. Repeat this for
Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wis-
dom, and Charisma, in that order. This
method gives a range of scores from 3 to 18,
with most results in the 9 to 12 range. Only
a few characters have high scores (15 and
above), so you should treasure these charac-
ters.
Alternative Dice-Rolling Methods
Method I creates
characters whose ability scores are usually
between 9 and 12. If you would rather play
a character of truly heroic proportions. ask
your DM if he allows players to use optional
methods for rolling up characters. These op-
tional methods are designed to produce
above-average characters.
0 Method H: Roll 3d6 twice, noting the to-
tal of each roll. Use whichever result you
prefer for your character's Strength score.
Repeat this for Dexterity. Constitution, in-
telligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. This al-
lows you to pick the best score from each
pair. generally ensuring that your character
does not have any really low ability scores
(but low ability scores are not all that bad
anywayl).
' Method lll: Roll 3d6 six times and jot
down the total for each roll. Assign the
scores to your character's six abilities how-
ever you want. This gives you the chance to
custom-tailor your character, although you
are not guaranteed high scores.
° Method IV: Roll 3d6 twelve times and jot
down all twelve totals. Choose six of these
rolls (generally the six best rolls) and assign
them to your character's abilities however
you want. This combines the best of meth-
ods ll and Ill, but takes somewhat longer.
As an example, loan rolls 3:16 twelve
times and gets results of 12, 5. 6, 8, 10, 15, 9,
12, 6, 11, 10, and 7. She chooses the six best
rolls(15, 12. 12, 11, 10, and 10) and then as-
signs them to her character's abilities so as to
create the strengths and weaknesses that she
wants her character to have (see the ability
descriptions following this section for expla-
nations of the abilities).
0 Method V: Roll four six-sided dice (4d6).
Discard the lowest die and total the remain-
ing three. Repeat this five more times, then
assign the six numbers to the character's
abilities however you want. This is a fast
method that gives you a good character, but
you can still get low scores (after all. you
could roll 1s on all four dice!).
I Method V1: This method can be used if
you want to create a specific type of charac-
ter. lt does not guarantee that you will get
the character you want, but it will improve
your chances.
Each ability starts with a score of 8. Then
roll seven dice. These dice can be added to
your character's abilities as you wish. All
the points on a die must be added to the
same ability score. For example, if a 6 is
rolled on one die, all 6 points must be as-
signed to one ability. You can add as many
dice as you want to any ability, but no abil-
ity score can exceed 18 points. if you cannot
make an 18 by exact count on the dice, you
cannot have an 18 score.
The Ability Scores
The six character
abilities are described below. Each descrip-
tion gives an idea of what that ability en-
compasses. Specific game effects are also
given. At the end of each ability description
is the table giving all modifiers and game in-
formation for each ability score. The un-
shaded area of these tables contains scores a
player character can have naturally, with-
out the aid of magical devices, spells. or di-
vine intervention. The blue-shaded ability
scores can be obtained only by extraordi-
nary means, whether by good fortune (find-
ing a magical book that raises a score) or ill
fortune (an attack by a creature that lowers
a score).
I3
".
Strength
Strength (Str) mea-
sures a character's muscle, endurance. and
stamina. This ability is the prime requisite
of warriors because they must be physically
powerful in order to wear armor and wield
heavy weapons. A fighter with a score of 16
or more in Strength gains a 10 percent bonus
to the experience points he earns.
Furthermore, any warrior with a Strength
score of 18 is entitled to roll percentile dice
(see Glossary) to detennine exceptional
Strength; exceptional Strength improves the
character's chance to hit an enemy, increases
the damage» he causes with each hit, in-
creases the weight the character is able to
carry without a penalty for encumbrance
(see below). and increases the character's
ability to force open doors and similar por-
tals.
The rest of this section on Strength con-
sists of explanations of the columns in Table
1. Refer to the table as you read.
Hit Probability adjustments are added to
or subtracted from the attack roll rolled on
1d2O (one 20-sided die) during combat. A
bonus (positive number) makes the oppo-
nent easier to hit; a penalty (negative num-
ber) makes him harder to hit.
Damage Adjustment also applies to com-
bat. The listed number is added to or sub-
tracted from the dice rolled to detennine the
damage caused by an attack (regardless of
subtractions. a successful attack roll can
never cause less than 1 point of damage).
For example. a short sword normally causes
1d6 points of damage (a range of 1 to 6). An
attacker with Strength 17 causes one extra
point of damage, for a range of 2 to 7 points
of damage. The damage adjustment also ap-
plies to missile weapons. although bows
must be specially made to gain the bonus;
crossbows never benefit from the user's
Strength.
Weight Allowance is the weight (in
pounds) a character can carry without being
encumbered (encumbrance measures how a
character's possessions hamper his
movement—see Glossary). These weights
are expressed in pounds. A character carry-
ing up to the listed weight can move his full
movement rate.
Maximum Press is the heaviest weight a
character can pick up and lift over his head.
A character cannot walk more than a few
steps this way, No human or humanoid
creature without exceptional Strength can
lift more than twice his body weight over his
head. ln 1987, the world record for lifting a
weight overhead in a single move was 465
pounds. A heroic fighter with Strength
18/00 (see Table 1) can lift up to 480 pounds
the same way and he can hold it overhead
for a longer time!

Open Doors indicates the character's
chance to force open a heavy or stuck door.
When a character tries to force a door open,
roll 1d20. lf the result i.s equal to or less than
the listed number, the door opens. A charac-
ter can keep trying to open a door until it
finally opens, but each attempt takes time
(exactly how much is up to the DM) and
makes a lot of noise.
Numbers in parentheses are the chances
(on 1d20) to open a locked, barred, or magi-
cally held door, but only one attempt per
door can ever be made. if it fails, no further
attempts by that character can succeed.
Bend Barslllft Gates states the character's
percentage chance (rolled on percentile dice)
to bend normal, soft iron bars, lift a vertical
gate (portcullis), or perform a similar feat of
enormous strength. When the character
makes the attempt, roll percentile dice. if
the number rolled is equal to or less than the
number listed on Table 1, the character
bends the bar or lifts the gate. If the attempt
fails, the character can never succeed at that
task. A character can, however, try to bend
the bars on a gate that he couldn't lift, and
vice vezsa.

Dexterity
Dexterity (Dex) en-
compasses several physical attributes
including hand-eye coordination, agility,
reaction speed, reﬂexes, and balance. Dex-
terity affects a character's reaction to a
threat or surprise. his accuracy with thrown
weapons and bows, and his ability to dodge
an enemy's blows. It is the prime requisite of
rogues and affects their professional skills.
A rogue with a Dexterity score of 16 or high-
er gains a 10 percent bonus to the experience
points he earns.
Reaction Adjustment modifies the die roll
to see if a character is surprised when he
unexpectedly encounters NPCs. The more
positive the modifier, the less likely the
character is to be surprised.
Missile Attack Adjustment is used to
modify a character's die roll whenever he
uses a missile weapon (a bow or a thrown
weapon). A positive number makes it easier
for the character to hit with a missile, while
a negative number makes it harder.
Defensive Adjustment applies to a char-
acter's saving throws (see Glossary) against
attacks that can be dodged—lightning bolts,
boulders, etc. it also modifies the character's
Armor Class (see Glossary), representing
his ability to dodge nonnal missiles and par-
ry weapon thrusts. For example, Rath is
wearing chain mail, giving him an Armor
Class of S. If his Dexterity score is 16, his
Annor Class is modiﬁed by -2 to 3, mak-
ing him harder to hit. if his Dexterity score
is 5, his Armor Class is modified by +2 to 7,
making him easier to hit. (ln some situa-
tions, beneficial Dexterity modifiers to
Armor Class do not apply. Usually this
occurs when a character is attacked from
behind or when his movement is
restricted—attacked while prone, tied up,
on a ledge, climbing a rope, etc.)

Constitution
A character's Con-
stitution (Con) score encompasses his phy-
sique, fitness, health, and physical
resistance to hardship, injury, and disease.
Since this ability affects the character's hit
points and chances of surviving such tre-
mendous shocks as being physically
reshaped by magic or resurrected from
death, it is vitally important to all classes.
Some classes have minimum allowable
Constitution scores.
A character's initial Constitution score is
the absolute limit to the number of times the
character can be raised or resurrected from
death. Each such revival reduces the charac-
ter's Constitution score by one. Magic can
restore a reduced Constitution score to its
original value or even higher, but this has no
effect an the number of times n character
can be revived from death! Once the charac-
ter has exhausted his original Constitution,
nothing short of divine intervention can
bring him back, and divine intervention is
reserved for only the bravest and mos:
faithful heroes]
For example, Rath's Constitution score at
the start of his adventuring career is 12. He
can be revived from death 12 times. if he
dies a 13th time, he cannot be resurrected or
raised.
Hit Point Adiustment is added to or sub-
tracted from each Hit Die rolled for the
character. However, no Hit Die ever yields
less than 1 hit point, regardless of modifica-
tions. lf an adjustment would lower the
number rolled to O or less, consider the final



result to be 1. Always use the characters
current Constitution to determine hit point
bonuses and penalties.
Only warriors are entitled to a Constitu-
tion bonus of +3 or +4. Non-warrior char-
acters who have Constitution scores of 17 or
18 receive only +2 per die.
The Constitution bonus ends when a
character reaches 10th level (9th for war-
riors and priests)—neither the Constitution
bonus nor Hit Dice are added to a charac-
ter's hit points after he has passed this level
(see the character class descriptions that
start on page 25).
lf a character's Constitution changes dur-
ir\g the course of adventuring, his hit points
may be adjusted up or down to reﬂect the
change. The difference between the charac-
ter's current hit point bonus (if any) and the
new bonus is multiplied by the character's
level (up to 10) and added to or subtracted
from the character's total. lf Delsenora's
Constitution increased from 16 to 17. she
would gain 1 hit point for every level she
had, up to 10th level.
System Shock states the percentage
chance a character has to survive magical
effects that reshape or age his body: petrifi-
cation (and reversing petrification), poly-
morph, magical aging, etc. It can also be
used to see if the character retains con-
sciousness in particularly difficult situa-
tions. For example, an evil mage
polymorphs his dim-witted hireling into a
crow. The hireling, whose Constitution
score is 13, has an 85 percent chance to sur-
vive the change. Assuming he survives, he
must successfully roll for system shock
again when he is changed back to his origi-
nal form or else he will die.
Resurrection Survival lists a character's
percentage chance to be successfully resur-
rected or raised from death by magic. The
player must roll the listed number or less on
percentile dice for the character to be
revived. If the dice roll fails, the character is
dead, regardless of how many times he has
previously been revived. Only divine inter-
vention can bring such a character back
again.
Poison Save modifies the saving throw
vs. poison for humans, elves, gnomes, and
half-elves. Dwarves and halﬂings do not use
this adjustment, since they have special
resistances to poison attacks. The DM has
specific information on saving throws.
Regeneration enables those with special-
iy endowed Constitutions (perhaps by a
wish or magical item) to heal at an advanced
rate, regenerating damage taken. The char-
acter heals 1 point of damage after the pas-
iage of the listed number of turns. However.
ire and acid damage (which are more exten-
iive than non-nal wounds) cannot be regen-
erated in this manner. These injuries must
ieal normally or be dealt with by magical
neans.

Intelligence
Intelligence (lnt)
represents a character's memory, reasoning,
and leaming ability, including areas outside
those measured by the written word. intelli-
gence dictates the number of languages a
character can leam. Intelligence is the prime
requisite of wizards, who must have keen
minds to understand and memorize magical
spells. A wizard with an lntelligence score
of 16 or higher gains a 10 percent bonus to
experience points eamed. The wizard's
lntelligence dictates which spells he can
learn and the number of spells he can memo-
rize at one time. Only those of the highest
Intelligence can comprehend the mighty
magic of 9th-level spells.
This ability gives only a general indica-
tion of a character's mental acuity. A senti-
intelligent character (lnt 3 or 4) can speak
(with difficulty) and is apt to react instinc-
tively and impulsively. He is not hopeless as
a player character (PC). but playing such a
character correctly is not easy. A character
with low Intelligence (lnt 5-7) could also be
called dull-witted or slow. A very intelligent
person (lnt 11 or 12) picks up new ideas
quickly and leams easily. A highly intelli-
gent character (lnt 13 or 14) is one who can
solve most problems without even trying
I5
very hard. One with exceptional intelli-
gence (lnt 15 or 16) is noticeably above the
norm. A genius character is brilliant (lnt 17
or 13). A character beyond genius is poten-
tially more dever and more brilliant than
can possibly be imagined.
However, the true capabilities of a mind
lie not in numbers—l.Q., lntelligence score,
or whatever. Many intelligent, even bril-
liant, people in the real world fail to apply
their minds creatively and usefully, thus
falling far below their own potential. Don't
rely too heavily on your character's intelli-
gence score: you must provide your charac-
ter with the creativity and energy he
supposedly possesses!
Number of Languages lists the number of
additional languages the character can
speak beyond his native language. Every
character can speak his native language, no
matter what his lntelligence is. This knowl-
edge extends only to speaking the language;
it does not include reading or writing. The
DM must decide if your character begins the
game already knowing these additional lan-
guages or if the number shows only how
many languages your character can possi-
bly leam. The first choice will make com-
munication easier, while the second
increases your opportunities for role-
playing (finding a tutor or creating a reason

Furthermore, your DM can limit your lan-

perfectly fair to rule that your fighter from
the Frozen Wastes hasn't the tongues of the
Southlands, simply because he has never
met anyone who has been to the South-
lands.
If the DM allows characters to have pro
ficiencies, this column also indicates the
number of extra proﬁciency slots the
character gains due to his Intelligence.
These extra proficiency slots can be used

ter never needs to spend any profidency
slots to speak his native language.
Spell Level lists the highest level of spells
that can be cast by a wizard with this Intelli-
gence.
Chance to Learn Spell is the percentage
probability that a wizard can learn a particu-

across new spells. not as he advances in level.
To make the check. the wizard character must
have access to a spell book containing the

Wisdom
Wisdom (Wis) de-

common sense, and intuition. lt can affect
the character's resistance to magical attadc.
lt is the prime requisite of priests; those with
a Wisdom score of 16 or higher gain a 10
percent bonus to experience points eamed.
Clerics, druids, and other priests with Wis-
dom scores of 13 or higher also gain bonus
spells over and above the number they are
normally allowed to use.
Magical Defense Adjustment listed on
Table 5 applies to saving throws against
magical spells that attack the mind: beguil-
ing, charm, fear, hypnosis, illusions. posses-
sion, suggestion, etc. These bonuses and
penalties are applied automatically, without
any conscious effort from the character.
Bonus Spells indicates the number of ad-
ditional spells a priest (and only a priest) is
entitled to because of his extreme Wisdom.
Note that these spells are available only
when the priest is entitled to spells of the ap-
propriate level. Bonus spells are cumula-
tive, so a priest with a Wisdom of 15 is
entitled to two 1st-level bonus spells and
one Znd-level bonus spell.
Chance of Spell Failure states the percent-
age chance that any particular spell fails
when cast. Priests with low Wisdom scores
run the risk of having their spells fizzle. Roll
percentile dice every time the priest casts a
spell; it the number rolled is less than or
equal to the listed chance for spell failure,
the spell is expended with absolutely no ef-
fect whatsoever. Note that priests with Wis-
dom scores of 13 or higher don't need to
worry about their spells failing.
Spell lmmunity gives those extremely wise
characters complete protection from certain
spells, spell-like abilities, and magical items as
listed. These immunities are cumulative, so
that a character with a Wisdom of Z3 is im-
mune to all listed spells up to and including
those listed on the 23 Wisdom row.

The Charisma (Cha)
score measures a character's persuasiveness,
personal magnetism, and ability to lead. lt is
not a reﬂection oi physical attractiveness, al-
though attractiveness certainly plays a role.
lt is important to all characters, but espe-
cially to those who must deal with non-
player characters (NPCs), mercenary
hirelings. retainers, and intelligent monsters.
it dictates the total number of henchmen a
character can retain and affects the loyalty of
henchmen, hirelings. and retainers.
Maximum Number of Henchmen states
the number of non-player characters who
will serve as permanent retainers of the
player character. lt does not affect the num-
I7
ber of mercenary soldiers, men-at-anns,
servitors. or other persons in the pay of the
character.
Loyalty Base shows the subtraction from
or addition to the henchmen's and other ser-
vitors' loyalty scores (in the DMG). This is
crucial during battles, when morale be-
comes important.
Reaction Adlustment indicates the pen-
alty or bonus due to the character because
of Charisma when dealing with non-player
characters and intelligent creatures. For ex-
ample, Rath encounters a centaur, an intelli-
gent creature. Rath's Charisma is only 6, so
he is starting off with one strike against him.
He probably should try to overcome this
slight handicap by making generous offers
of gifts or information.

What the Numbers Mean
Now that you have
ﬁnished creating the ability scores for your
character, stop and take a look at them.
What does all this mean?
Suppose you decide to name your charac-
ter "Roth" and you rolled the following abil-
ity scores for him:
Strength 8
Dexterity 14
Constitution 13
intelligence 13
Wisdom 7
Charisma 6
Rath has strengths and weaknesses, but it
is up to you to interpret what the numbers
mean. Here are just two different ways these
numbers could be interpreted.
1) Although Rath is in good health (Con
13), he's not very strong (Str B) because he's
just plain lazy—he never wanted to exercise
as a youth and now it's too late. His low
Wisdom and Charisma scores (7, 6) show
that he lacks the common sense to apply
himself properly and projects a slothful,
Ii" Ability Scores (What the Numbers Mean)
"l'm not going to bother" attitude (which
tends to irritate others). Fortunately, Rath’s
natural wit (lnt 13) and Dexterity (14) keep
him from being a total loss.
Thus you might play Rath as an irritat-
ing, smart-alecky twerp forever ducking
just out of range of those who want to
squash him.
Z) Rath has several good points—he has
studied hard (lnt 13) and practiced his man-
ual skills (Dex 14). Unfortunately, his
Strength is low (8) from a lack of exercise
(all those hours spent reading books).
Despite that, Rath's health is still good (Con
13). His low Wisdom and Charisma (7, 6)
are a result of his lack of contact and
involvement with people outside the realm
of academics.
Looking at the scores this way, you could
play Rath as a kindly, naive, and shy profes-
sorial type who's a good tinkerer, always
fiddling with new ideas and inventions.
Obviously, Rath's ability scores (often
called "stats") are not the greatest i.n the
world. Yet it is possible to turn these "disap-
pointing" stats into a character who is both
interesting and fun to play. Too often play-
ers become obsessed with "good" stats.
These players immediately give up on a
character if he doesn't have a majority of

aboveaverage scores. There are even those
who feel a character is hopeless if he does
not have at least one ability of 17 or higher!
Needless to say, these players would never
consider playing a character with ar\ ability
score of 6 or 7.
ln truth, Rath's survivability has a lot less
to do with his ability scores than with your
desire to role-play him. If you give up on
him, of course he won't survive! But if you
take an interest in the character and role-
play him well, then even a character with
the lowest possible scores can present a fun,
challenging. and all-around exciting time.
Does he have a Charisma of 57 Why‘! May-
be he's got an ugly scar. His table manners
could be atrocious. He might mean well but
always manage to say the wrong thing at the
wrong time. He could be bluntly honest to
the point of rudeness, something not likely
to endear him to most people. His Dexterity
is a 3? Why’! ls he naturally clumsy or blind
as a bat?
Don't give up on a character just because
he has a low score. lnstead, view it as an
opportunity to role~play, to create a unique
and entertaining personality in the game.
Not only will you have fun creating that
personality, but other players and the DM
will have fun reacting to him.

- ' Chapter 2= Player Character Races
After creating your characters ability
scores, you must select a player character
race. This is not a race in the true sense of
the word: caucasian, black. asian. etc. It is
actually a fantasy species for your
character—human, elf, dwarf, gnome. half-
elf, or halfling. Each race is different. Each
possesses special powers and has different
lists of classes to choose from.
All six of the standard races are described
in detail in this chapter. ln many cases.
broad statements are made conceming the
race in general. Players are not bound by
these generalities. For example, the state-
ment that "dwarves tend to be dour and tac-
itum" does not mean that your character
cannot be a jolly dwarf. lt means that the
garden-variety dwarf is dour and taciturn.
lf player characters were just like everyone
else, they wouldn't be adventurers. Make
your character unique and he will be more
fun to play.
Mlnlmurn and Maximum
Ahlllty Scores
All non-human PC
races (also called “clemihuman" races) have
minimum and maximum requirements for
their ability scores. lf you want to have a de-
mihuman character, the character's ability
scores must be within the allowable range.
The minimums and maximums for each race
are listed on Table 7 (the minimums are
listed before the slash: the maximums are
listed after the slash). Your characters sex
has no effect on these minimums or maxi-
mums.
Consult Table 7 before making any racial
adjustments to your character's ability
scores. If the basic scores that you rolled up
meet the requirements for a particular race.
your character can be of that race, even if
later modifications change the ability scores
so they exceed the maximums or don't meet
the minimums. Once you satisfy the re-
quirements at the start. you never have to
worry about them again,
Table 7 gives the minimum and maximum
scores a newly created character must have
to be a member of a demihuman race. Any
character can be a human, if the player so
desires.
Raclal Ablllty Ad|ust|nents
lf you chose to
make your character a dwarf, elf, gnome. or
halfling, you now have to adjust some of
your character's ability scores. The adjust-
ments are mandatory; all characters of these
races receive the adjustments. Even if ad-
justments raise or lower your characters
ability scores beyond the minimums and
maximums shown on Table 7, you do not
have to pick n new race. The adjustments
can also raise a score to 19 or lower it to 2.

Class Restrictions and level Llmlts
The human race
has one special ability in the AD&D@ game:
Humans can choose to be of any class-
warrior, wizard, priest, or rogue—and can
rise to great level in any class. The other
races have fewer choices of character classes
and usually are limited in the level they can
attain. These restrictions reﬂect the natural
tendencies of the races (dwarves like war
and fighting and dislike magic. etc.). The
limits are high enough so a demihuman can
achieve power and importance in at least
one class. A halfling, for example, can be-
come the best thief in the land, but he can-
not become a great fighter.
The limits also exist for play balance. The
ability of humans to assume any role and
reach any level is their only advantage. The
demihuman races have other powers that
make them entertaining to play-
particularly the ability to be multi-classed
(see Glossary). These powers balance the
enjoyment of play against the ability to rise
in level. Ask your DM for the level limits
imposed on non-human characters.

Languages
Racial languages
for demihumans can be handled in either of
two ways, depending on whether or not
your DM uses the optional proficiency sys-
tem. Either way, your character automati-
cally knows his native language.
Without the proficiency system, your
character starts adventuring already know-
ing a number of additional languages (the
number depends on his lnt score, see Table
4). The additional languages must be chosen
from among those listed in his race's de-
scription.
If you use the proﬁciency system, your
character receives additional languages
by using proficiency slots (see page51) to
determine how many languages he
knows when he starts adventuring (his
native language does not cost a slot). De-
rnihumans must choose these languags
from among those listed in the following
racial descriptions.
Human PCs generally start the game
knowing only their regional language—the
language they grew up speaking. The DM
may decide to allow beginning PCs addi-
tional languages (up to their lnt score limit
or proficiency slot limit). if he feels the PCs
had the opportunity to learn these as they
grew up. Otherwise, human PCs may learn
additional languages as they adventure.
Dwarves
Dwarves are short.
stocky fellows, easily identified by their size
and shape. They average 4 to 4‘/2 feet tall.
They have niddy cheeks, dark eyes, and
dark hair, Dwarves generally live for 350
years.
Dwarves tend to be dour and tacitum,
They are given to hard work and care little
for most humor. They are strong and brave.
They enjoy beer. ale, mead, and even
stronger drink. Their chief love, however, is
precious metal, particularly gold. They
prize gems. of course, especially diamonds
and opaque gems (except pearls, which they
do not like). Dwarves like the earth and dis-
like the sea. Not overly fond of elves, they
have a fierce hatred of orcs and goblins.
Their short, stocky builds make them ill-
suited for riding horses or other large
mounts (although ponies present no diffi-
culty). so they tend to be a trifle dubious
and wary of these creatures. They are ill-
disposed toward magic and have little talent
for it, but revel in fighting, warcraft, and
scientific arts such as engineering.
Though dwarves are suspicious and ava-
ricious, their courage and tenacity more
than compensate for these shortcomings.



Dwarves typically dwell in hilly or moun-
tainous regions. They prefer life in the com-
forting gloom and solidness that is found
underground. They have several special
abilities that relate to their underground
life, and they are noted for being particular-
ly resistant to magics and poisons.
A character of the dwarven race can be a
cleric, a fighter, or a thief. He can also
choose to be a fighter/cleric or fighterl thief.
From living underground, dwarves have
found it useful to learn the languages of sev-
eral of their neighbors, both friendly and
hostile. The initial languages a dwarf can
learn are common, dwarf, gnome, goblin.
kobold, orc, and any others your DM
allows. The actual number of languages is
limited by the Intelligence of the player
character (see Table 4) or by the proficiency
slots he allots to languages (if that optional
system is used).
By nature, dwarves are nonmagical and
never use magical spells (clerical spells are
allowed however). This gives a b0nus to
dwarves’ saving throws against attacks
from magical wands, staves, rods, and
spells. This bonus is +1 for every 31/z
points of Constitution score. Thus, for
example, if a dwarf has a Constitution score
of 7 he gains +2 on saving throws. These
bonuses are summarized on Table 9.
Table 9: CONSTITUTION SAVING
THROW BONUSES
Constitution Score Saving Throw Bonus
4P6 4‘ 1
7-10 +2
11-13 +3
14-17 +4
18-19 +5
Similarly, dwarves have exceptional
resistance to toxic substances. All dwarven
characters make saving throws against poi-
son with the same bonuses that they get
against magical attacks (see Table 9).
Also because of their nonmagical nature,
however, dwarves have trouble using magi-
cal items. All magical items that are not spe
cifically suited to the character's class have a
20 percent diance to malfunction when used
by a dwarf. This check is made each time a
dwarf uses a magical item. A malfunction
affects only the current use; the item may
work properly next time. For devices that
are continually in operation, the check is
made the ﬁrst time the device is used during
an encounter. If the check is passed, the
device functions normally until it is tumed
off. Thus a dwarf would have to check upon
donning a robe of blending but would not
check again until he had taken the robe off
and then put it on again. If a cursed item
malfunctions, the character recognizes its
cursed nature and can dispose of the item.
Malfunction applies to rods, staves, wands,
rings, amulets, potions, horns. jewels, and
all other magical items except weapons,
shields, armor, gauntlets, and girdles. This
penalty does not apply to dwarven clerics
using clerical items.
ln melee, dwarves add 1 to their dice rolls
to hit orcs, half-orcs, goblins, and hobgob-
lins. When ogres, trolls, ogre magi, giants.
or titans attack dwarves, these monsters
must subtract 4 from their attack rolls
because of the dwarves‘ small size and com-
bat ability against these much bigger crea-
tures.
Dwarven infravision enables them to see
up to 60 feet in the dark.
Dwarves are miners of great skill. While
underground, they can detect the following
information when within 10 feet of the par-
ticular phenomenon (but they can deter-
mine their approximate depth below the
surface at any time).
Detect grade or slope
in passage
Detect new tunnel/passage
construction
Detect sliding/shifting walls
or rooms
Detect stonework traps, pits,
and deadfalls

Note that the dwarf must deliberately try
to make these determinations; the informa-
tion does not simply spring to mind unbid~
den.
Because of their sturdy builds, dwarves
add 1 to their initial Constitution scores.
Their dour and suspicious natures cause
them to subtract 1 from their initial Cha-
risma scores.

Elves
Elves tend to be
somewhat shorter and slimmer than normal
humans. Their features are finely chiseled
and delicate, and they speak in melodic
tones. Although they appear fragile and
weak, as a race they are quick and strong,
Elves often live to be over 1,200 years old,
although long before this time they feel
compelled to depart the realms of men and
mortals. Where they go is uncertain, but it is
an undeniable urge of their race.
Elves are often considered frivolous and
aloof. In fact, they are not, although
humans often find their personalities impos-
sible to fathom. They concem themselves
with natural beauty, dancing and frolicking,
playing and singing. unless necessity dic-
tates otherwise. They are not fond of ships
or mines, but enjoy growing things and gaz-
ing at the open sky. Even though elves tend
toward haughtiness and arrogance at times,
they regard their friends and associates as
equals. They do not make friends easily, but
ll
\ .
a friend (or enemy) is never forgotten. They
prefer to distance themselves from humans,
have little love for dwarves, and hate the
evil denizens of the woods.
Their humor is clever, as are their songs
and poetry. Elves are brave but never fool-
hardy. They eat sparingly; they drink mead
and wine, but seldom to excess. While they
find well-wrought jewelry a pleasure to
behold, they are not overly interested in
money or gain. They find magic and sword-
play (or any reﬁned combat art) fascinating.
if they have a weakness it lies in these inter-
ESIS.
There are five branches of the elven
race: aquatic, gray, high, wood, and dark.
Elf player characters are always assumed to
be of the most common type—high elves-
although a character can be another type of
elf with the DM's permission (but the choice
grants no additional powers). To the eye of
outsiders, the differences between the
groups are mostly cosmetic, but most elves
maintain that there are important cultural
differences between the various groups.
Aquatic elves spend their lives beneath the
waves and have adapted to these condi-
tions. Gray elves are considered the most
noble and serious-minded of this breed.
High elves are the most common. Wood
elves are considered to be wild, tempera-
mental, and savage. All others hold that the
subterranean dark elves are corrupt and
evil, no longer part of the elven community.
A player character elf can be a cleric,
fighter, mage, thief, or ranger. In addition,
an elf can choose to be a multi-class fighterl
mage, fighterl thief, fighter/mage/thief, or
mage/thief. (The rules governing these
combinations are explained under Multi-
Class Characters, page 44.)
Elves have found it useful to learn the lan-
guages of several of the forest's children,
both the good and the bad. As initial lan-
guages, an elf can choose common, elf,
gnome, halfling, goblin, hobgoblin. orc,
and gnoll. The number of languages an elf
can learn is limited by his Intelligence (see
Table 4) or the proficiency slots he allots to
languages (if that optional system is used).
Elven characters have 90 percent resist-
ance to sleep and all chann-related spells.
(See Chapter 9: Combat for an explanation
of magic resistance.) This is in addition to
the normal saving throw allowed against a
charm spell.
When employing a bow of any sort other
than a crossbow, or when using a short or
long sword, elves gain a bonus of +1 to
their attack rolls.
An elf can gain a bonus to surprise oppo-
nents, but only if the elf is not in metal
armor. Even then, the elf must either be
alone, or with a party comprised only of
elves or halflings (also not in metal armor).
or 90 feet or more away from his party (the
group of characters he is with) to gain this



' ’ Races (Gnomes)
bonus. If he fulﬁlls these conditions, he
moves so silently that opponents suffer a
-'4 penalty to their surprise die rolls. If the
elf must open a door or screen to attack, this
penalty is reduced to -2.
Elven infravision enables them to see up
to 60 feet in darkness.
Secret doors (those constructed so as to
be hard to notice) and concealed doors
(those hidden from sight by screens, cur-
tains, or the like) are difficult to hide from
elves. Merely passing within 10 feet of a
concealed door gives an elven character a
one-in-six chance (roll a 1 on 1d6) to notice
it, if actively searching for such doors, elven
characters have a one-in-three chance (roll a
1 or 2 on 1d6) to find a secret door and a
one-in-two chance (roll a 1, 2, or 3 on 1d6)
to discover a concealed portal.
As stated previously, elven characters
add 1 to their initial Dexterity scores. Like-
wise, as elves are not as sturdy as humans,
they deduct 1 from their initial Constitution
scora.
Gnomes
Kin to dwarves.
gnomes are noticeably smaller than their
distant cousins. Gnomes, as they proudly
maintain, are also less rotund than dwarves.
Their noses, however, are significantly
larger. Most gnomes have dark tan or
brown skin and white hair. A typical gnome
lives for 350 years.
Gnomes have lively and sly senses of hu-
mor, especially for practical jokes. They
have a great love of living things and finely
wrought items, particularly gems and jew-
elry. Gnomes love all sorts of precious
stones and are masters of gem polishing and
cutting.
Gnomes prefer to live in areas of rolling,
rocky hills, well wooded and uninhabited
by humans. Their diminutive stature has
made them suspicious of the larger races-
humans and elves—althoug,h they are not
hostile. They are sly and furtive with those
they do not know or trust, and somewhat
reserved even under the best of circum-
stances. Dwelling in mines and burrows,
they are sympathetic to dwarves, but ﬁnd
their cousins’ aversion to surface dwellers
foolish.
A gnome character can elect to be a
fighter, a thief, a cleric, or an illusionist. A
gnome can have two classes, but not three:
fighter/thief, illusionistl thief, etc.
Due to his upbringing, a beginning gnome
character can choose to know the following
languages, in addition to any others allowed
by the DM: common, dwarf, gnome, half-
ling, goblin, kobold, and the simple com-
mon speech of burrowing mammals imoles,
badgers, weasels, shrews, ground squirrels,
etc-). The actual number of languages a
character begins with depends upon his in-
telligence score (see Table 4) or the profi-
ciency slots he allots to languages (if that
optional system is used).
Like their cousins the dwarves, gnomes
are highly magic resistant. A gnome player
character gains a bonus of + 1 for every 31/z
points of Constitution score, just as
dwarves do (see Table 9). This bonus ap-
plies to saving throws against magical
wands, staves, rods, and spells.
Gnomes also suffer a 20 percent chance
for failure every time they use any magical
item except weapons, armor, shields, illu-
sionist items, and (if the character is a thief)
items that duplicate thieving abilities. This
check is made each time the gnome attempts
to use the device or, in the case of
continuous-use devices, eadt time the de-
vice is activated. Like dwarves, gnomes can
sense a cursed item if the device fails to func-
tion.
ln melee, gnome characters add 1 to their
attack rolls to hit kobolds or goblins. When
gnolls, bugbears, ogres, trolls, ogre magi.
giants, or titans attack gnomes, these mon-
sters must subtract 4 from their attack rolls
because of the gnomes’ small size and their
combat skills against these much larger
creatures.
Gnomish infravision enables them to see
up to 60 feet in the dark.
Being tunnelers of exceptional merit,
gnomes are able to detect the following
within 10 feet (exception: They can deter-
mine their approximate depth or direction
underground at any time.). They must stop
and concentrate for one round to use any of
these abilities.
Detect grade or slope
in passage 1-5 on 1d6
Detect unsafe walls, ceiling,
and floors 1-7 on 1d10
Determine approx. depth
underground 1-4 on 1d6
Determine approx. direction
underground 1-3 on 1d6
Gnome characters gain a +1 bonus to
their Intelligence scores, to reflect their
highly inquisitive natures. They stiffer a * 'l
penalty to Wisdom because their curiosity
often leads them unknowingly into danger.
Half-Elves
Half-elves are the
most common mixed-race beings. The rela-
tionship between elf, human, and half-elf is
defined as follows: 1) Anyone with both el-
ven and human ancestors is either a human
or a half-elf (elves have only elven ances-
tors). 2) If there are more human ancestors
than elven, the person is human; if there are
equal numbers or more elves, the person is
half-elven.
Half-elves are usually much like their el-
ven parent in appearance. They are hand-
ll
some folk, with the good features of each of
their races. They mingle freely with either
race, being only slightly taller than the aver-
age elf (5 feet 6 inches on average) and
weighing about 150 pounds. They typically
live about 160 years. They do not have all
the abilities of the elf, nor do they have the
flexibility of unlimited level advancement of
the human. Finally, in some of the less-
civilized nations, half-elves are viewed with
suspicion and superstition.
in general, a half-elf has the curiosity, in-
ventiveness, and ambition of his human an-
cestors and the refined senses, love of
nature, and artistic tastes of his elven ances-
tors.
Half-elves do not form communities
among themselves; rather, they can be
found living in both elven and human com-
munities. The reactions of humans and elves
to half-elves ranges from intrigued fascina-
tion to outright bigotry.
Of all the demihuman races, half-elves
have the greatest range of choices in charac-
ter dass. They tend to make good druids
and rangers. A half-elf can choose to be a
cleric, druid, fighter, ranger, mage. special-
ist wizard, thief, or bard. ln addition, a half-
elf can choose from the following
multi—class combinations: cleric (or druid)/
fighter, cleric (or dniid)/fighter/mage,
cleric (or druid)/ranger, cleric (or druid)/
mage, fighter/mage, fighter/thief, fighterl
mage/thief, and magel thief. The half-elf
must abide by the rules for multi-class char-
acters.
Half-elves do not have a language of their
own. Their extensive contact with other
races enables them to choose any of the fol-
lowing languages (plus any other allowed
by the DM): common, elf. gnome, halfling,
goblin, hobgoblin, orc, and gnoll. The ac-
tual number of languages the character
knows is limited by his intelligence (see Ta-
ble 4) or by the number of proficiency slots
he allots to languages (if that optional sys-
tem is used).
Half-elven characters have a 30 percent
resistance to sleep and all charm-related
spells.
Half-elven infravision enables them to see
up to 60 feet in darkness.
Secret or concealed doors are difficult to
hide from half-elves, just as they are from
elves. Merely passing within 10 feet of a
concealed door (one hidden by obstructing
curtains, etc.) gives the half-elven character
a one-in-six chance (roll a 1 on 1d6) of spot-
ting it. If the character is actively seeking to
discover hidden doors, he has a one-in-three
chance (roll a 1 or Z on 1d6) of spotting a se-
cret door (one constructed to be undetect-
able) and a one-in-two chance (roll a 1, Z, or
3 on 1d6) of locating a concealed door.



Halﬂings
Halflings are short.
generally plump people, very much like
small humans. Their faces are round and
broad and often quite ﬂorid. Their hair is
typically curly and the tops of their feet are
covered with coarse hair. They prefer not to
wear shoes whenever possible. Their typical
life expectancy is approximately 150 years.
Halflings are sturdy and industrious, gen-
erally quiet and peaceful. Overall they pre-
fer the comforts of home to dangerous
adventuring. They enjoy good living, rough
humor, and homespun stories. in fact, they
can be a trifle boring at times. Halﬂings are
not forward, but they are observant and
conversational if in friendly company. Half-
lings see wealth only as a means of gaining
creature comforts, which they love. Though
they are not overly brave or ambitious, they
are generally honest and hard working
when there is need.
Halfling homes are well-fumished bur-
rows, although most of their work is done
on the surface. Elves generally like them in a
patronizing sort of way. Dwarves cheerfully
tolerate them, thinking halflings somewhat
soft and harmless. Gnomes, although they
drink more and eat less, like halflings best.
feeling them kir\d.red spirits. Because half-
lings are more open and outgoing than any
of these other three. they get along with oth-
er races far better.
There are three types of halflings: Hair-
feets, Tallfellows, and Stouts. Hairfeets are
the most common type, but for player char-
acters, any of the three is acceptable.
A halfling character can choose to be a
cleric, fighter, thief, or a multi-class fighter/
thief. The halfling must use the rules provid-
ed for multi-class characters.
Through their contact with other races,
halfling characters are allowed to choose
initial languages from common, halfling,
dwarf, elf, gnome, goblin, and orc, in addi-
tion to any other languages the DM allows.
The actual number of languages the charac-
ter knows is limited by his intelligence (see
Table 4) or by the number of proficiency
slots he allots to languages (if that optional
system is used).
All halfling characters have a high resist-
ance to magical spells, so for every 3‘/2
points of Constitution score. the character
gains a +1 bonus on saving throws vs.
wands, staves, rods, and spells. These
bonuses are summarized on Table 9.
Halflings have a similar resistance to poi-
sons of all sorts, so they gain a Constitution
bonus identical to that for saving throws vs.
magical attacks when they make saving
throws vs. poison (i.e., +1 to +5, depend-
ing on Constitution score).
Halflings have a natural talent with slings
and thrown weapons. Rock pitching is a
favorite sport of many a halfling child. All
halflings gain a +1 bonus to their attack
rolls when using thrown weapons and
slings.
A halfling can gain a bonus to surprise
opponents, but only if the halfling is not in
metal armor. Even then, the halfling must
either be alone, or with a party comprised
only of halflings or elves, or 90 feet or more
away from his party to gain this bonus. if he
fulfills any of these conditions. he causes a
- 4 penalty to opponents’ surprise rolls. lf a
door or other screen must be opened, this
penalty is reduced to -2.
Depending on their lineage, certain half-
ling characters have infravision. Any half-
ling character has a 15 percent chance to
have normal infravision (this means he is
pure Stout), out to 60 feet; failing that
chance, there is a 25 percent chance that he
has limited infravision (mixed Stout/
Tallfellow or Stout/Hairfeets lineage), effec-
tive out to 30 feet.
Similarly, halflings with any Stoutish
blood can note if a passage is an up or down
grade with 75 percent accuracy (roll a 1, 2,
or 3 on 1d4). They can determine direction
half the time (roll a 1, 2. or 3 on ldfs). These
abilities function only when the character is
concentrating on the desired information to
the exclusion of all else, and only if the char-
acter is pure or partially Stout.
Halﬂing characters have a penalty of -'1
to their initially generated Strength scores.
and they gain a bonus of + 1 to Dexterity.
Humans
Although humans
are treated as a single race in the AD&D@
game, they come in all the varieties we
know on Earth. A human PC can have
whatever racial characteristics the DM
allows.
Humans have only one special ability:
They can be of any character class and rise
to any level in any class. Other PC races
have limited choices in these areas.
Humans are also more social and tolerant
than most other races, accepting the compa-
ny of elves, dwarves, and the like with
noticeably less complaint.
Because of these abilities and tendencies.
humans have become significant powers
within the world and often rule empires that
other races (because of their racial tenden-
cies) would find difficult to manage.
Other Characteristics
After you have
selected a race. you may want to fill in the
details of your character. You are not
required to do so, but there are many situa-
tions in which this information is vital or
useful to role-playing.
The sex and name of your character are
up to you. Your character can be of the same
13
Races(Halflings) ‘ ‘
sex as yourself or of the opposite sex.
Some people feel it is important to know
whether their character is right- or left-
handed. Actually, this has no bearing on the
play of the game, since all diaracters are
assumed to be reasonably competent with
either hand (that doesn't mean everyone is
trained to fight with two weapons). lt is easiest
to say that your character has the same hand-
edness as you. This will result in the normal
ratio of right- to left-handed people.
On occasion it may be useful to know
your character's height and weight. The best
way to determine height and weight is to
choose the appropriate numbers, subject to
your DM's approval. lf you want a short,
pudgy human ﬁghter, you can select an
appropriate height and weight. Otherwise,
heights and weights can be generated ran-
domly using Table 10 (next page). Take the
appropriate base score and add the die roll
modifier. As with all tables, this can create
some ridiculous results (one of the problems
with randomness) and, at the same time,
cannot account for the full variety of man-
kind (or demihurnankind). The table only
reproduces a fairly average range for each
race. Heights and weights for demihuman
races not listed on the table must be decided
by your DM.
The tallest man on record stood 8 feet
11.1 inches, while the tallest woman was
8 feet 1.25 indies. The shortest man was
only 26.5 indies tall and the shortest
woman bettered this at only 24 inches in
height. While the liﬂrtest humans are
also among the shortest, the heaviest
man weighed an estimated 1.400 pounds
and stood only 6 feet 1 inch. The heaviest
woman is thought to have weighed B00
pounds. Obviously, these figures indi-
catethatthereisagreatdealofvariety
possible for player characters.
Players may also want to know their
characters’ starting ages. Human characters
can start at any age that is agreeable to both
the player and the DM. However, all begin-
ning adventurers are assumed to be at least
16 years old. since they must grow physi-
cally, emotionally, and in practical experi-
ence before they are ready to undertake the
rigors of an adventuring life. Table 11 can be
used to give a starting age (add the variable
die roll to the base starting age to get the
character's starting age) and the possible life
span of a character, assuming a quiet and
peaceful life. Humans are also included on
this list in case you want to determine their
ages randomly. The maximum age for a
character should be secretly determined and
recorded by the DM. Player characters may
have an idea of how long they expect to live.
but do not know their true allotted life
spans.



‘ ' Races (Characteristics)
As a character ages, his ability scores are
affected. Upon reaching one-half of his base
maximum age (45 for a human), the charac-
ter loses 1 point of Strength (or half of his
exceptional Strength rating) and 1 point of
Constitution, but gains 1 point each of intel-
ligence and Wisdom. At two-thirds of his
base maximum age (60 for a human), the
character loses 2 more points of Strength (or
all his exceptional Strength and 1 point
more), 2 points of Dexterity, and 1 more
point of Constitution, but he gains 1 point
of Wisdom. Upon reaching the base maxi-
mum age, the character loses 1 more point
from each of Strength, Dexterity, and Con-
stitution, while gaining 1 more point in both
Intelligence and Wisdom. All aging adjust-
ments are cumulative. See Table 12 for a
summary of these effects.
Although many people have claimed to
livetogreatages, theoldesthumanof
vaifiable age was 113 years old in 1988
and is still alive!
There may be times when a magical
device or spell adds years to or subtracts
years from a player character's life. This
magical aging can have two different
effects. Some magical aging physically
affects the character. For example. a haste
spell ages those it affects by one year. This
aging is added directly to the player charac-
ter's current age. He physically acquires the
appearance of himself one year older (a few
more wrinkles, etc.). Characters who
increase in age from magical effects do not
gain the benefits of increased Wisdom and
intelligence—these are a function of the pas-
sage of game time—but the character does
suffer the physical losses to Strength, Dex-
terity, and Constitution associated with
aging. Thse are breakdowns of the body's
systems. Physical age can also be removed
in the same manner. Some potions give
years back to the character. ln this case, the
physical appearance of the character is
restored. The character can regain lost vigor
(Str, Dex, and Con) as his body is renewed
but he does not lose any of the benefits of
aging (Wis and int).
Magical aging can also work to increase
or decrease the life span of the character. lr\
such a case, the actual age of the character is
unaffected. All adiustments are made by the
DM to the character's maximum age (which
only the DM knows). For example, a human
finds a magical fountain that bestows great
longevity (10 to 60 years more). The DM
has already determined the human will nat-
urally live to 103 years (base 90 + 2d20, in
this case 13). The water of the fountain
bestows 40 more years so that, unless the
character meets a violent end, he will live to
143 years. He still suffers the effects of aging
at the usual ages (45, 60. and 90 years,
respectively), but the period in which he
would be considered a venerable elder of his
people is extended for 40 years.
There are a number of other personal
characteristics your character has—hair
and eye color, body shape. voice, noticeable
features, and general personality. There are
no tables for these things, nor should there
be. Your job, as a player, is to add these
details, thereby creating the type of charac-
ter you want. You probably know some
from the start (do you want to play a tower-
ing, robust warrior, or a slim, unassuming
swordsmani); others, especially your char-
acter's personality, will grow and take fomi
as you play. Remember, you are an actor
and your character is your role!

Chapter 3: Player Ch
After choosing your character's race, you
select his character class. A character class is
like a profession or career. lt is what your
character has worked and trained at during
his younger years. lf you wanted to become
a doctor, you could not walk out the door
and begin work immediately. First you
would have to get some training. The same
is true of character classes in the AD&D”
game. Your character is assumed to have
some previous training and guidance before
beginning his adventuring career. Now,
armed with a little knowledge, your charac-
ter is ready to make his name and fortune.
The character classes are divided into
four groups according to general occupa-
tions: warrior, wizard, priest, and rogue.
Within each group are several similar char-
acter classes. All classes within a group
share the same Hit Dice, as well as combat
and saving throw progressions. Each char-
acter class within a group has different spe-
cial powers and abilities that are available
only to that class. Fach player must select a
group for his character, then a specific class
within that group.
Warrior Wizard Priest
Fighter Mage Cleric
Ranger Illusionist Druid
Paladin Other Other
Rogue
Thief
Bard
Fighter, mage, cleric, and thief are the
standard classes. They are historical and
legendary archetypes that are common
to many different cultures. Thus they are
appropriate to any sort of ADkD game
mmpa£gn.Alloftheotherclassesareop-
tional. Your DM may decide that one or
more of the optional classes are not ap-
propriate to his campaign setting. Check
with your DM before selecting an op-
tional character class.
To help you choose your character's class,
each group and its subordinate classes are
described briefly. The groups and classes are
described in detail later in this chapter.
Warrior-. There are three different classes
within the warrior group: fighter, paladin.
and ranger. All are well-trained in the use of
weapons and skilled in the martial arts.
The fighter is a champion, swordsman,
soldier, and brawler. He lives or dies by his
knowledge of weapons and tactics. Fighters
can be found at the front of any battle, con-
testing toe-to-toe with monsters and vil-
lains. A good fighter needs to be strong and
healthy if he hopes to survive.
The paladin is a warrior bold and pure, the
exemplar of everything good and true. Like
the fighter, the paladin is a man of combat.
However, the paladin lives for the ideals of
righteousness, justice, honesty, piety, and
chivalry. He strives to be a living example of
these virtues so that others might leam from
him as well as gain by his actions.
The ranger is a warrior and a woodsman.
He is skilled with weapons and is knowl-
edgeable in tracking and Woodcraft. The
ranger often protects and guides lost trav-
elers and honest peasant-folk. A ranger
needs to be strong and wise to the ways of
nature to live a full life.
Wizard: The wizard strives to be a master
of magical energies, shaping them and cast-
ing them as spells. To do so, he studies
strange tongues and obscure facts and de-
votes much of his time to magical research.
A wizard must rely on knowledge and wit
to survive. Wizards are rarely seen adven-
turing without a retinue of fighters and
men-at-amis.
Because there are different types (or
schools) of magic, there are different types
of wizards. The mage studies all types of
magic and learns a wide variety of spells.
His broad range makes him well suited to
the demands of adventuring. The illusionist
is an example of how a wizard can specialize
in a particular school of magic, illusion in
this case.
Priest: A priest sees to the spiritual needs
of a community or location. Two types of
priests—clerics and druids—are described
in the Player's Handbook. Other types can
be created by the DM to suit specific cam-
paigns.
The cleric is a generic priest (of any my-
thos) who tends to the needs of a commu-
nity. He is both protector and healer. He is
not purely defensive, however. When evil
threatens, the cleric is well-suited to seek it
out on its own ground and destroy it.
The dmid class is optional; it is an exam-
ple of how the priest can be adapted to a cer-
tain type of setting. The druid serves the
cause of nature and neutrality; the wilder-
ness is his community. He uses his special
powers to protect it and to preserve balance
in the world.
Rogue: The rogue can be found through-
out the world, wherever people gather and
money changes hands. While many rogues
are motivated only by a desire to amass for-
tune in the easiest way possible. some
rogues have noble aims; they use their skills
to correct injustice, spread good will, or
contribute to the success of an adventuring
group.
There are two types of rogues: thieves
and bards.
To accomplish his goals, for good or ill,
the thief is a skilled pilferer. Cunning, nim-
bleness, and stealth are his hallmarks.
Whether he tums his talent against innocent
passers~by and wealthy merchants or op-
pressors and monsters is a choice for the
thief to make.
The bard is also a rogue, but he is very
different from the thief. His strength is his
pleasant and charming personality. With it
and his wits he makes his way through the
world. A bard is a talented musician and a
15
walking storehouse of gossip, tall tales, and
lore. He learns a little bit about everything
that crosses his path; he is a jack-of-all-
trades but master of none. While many
bards are scoundrels, their stories and songs
are welcome almost everywhere.
Class Ablllty Score Requirements
Each of the charac-
ter classes has minimum scores in various
abilities. A character must satisfy these min-
imums to be of that class. lf your character's
scores are too low for him to belong to any
character class, ask your DM for permission
to reroll one or more of your ability scores
or to create an entirely new character. If you
desperately want your character to belong
to a particular class but have scores that are
too low, your DM might allow you to in-
crease these scores to the minimum needed.
However, you must ask him first. Don't
count on the DM allowing you to raise a
score above 16 in any case.

VZ Classes (Fighter)
Class Descriptions
The complete char-
acter class descriptions that follow give the
specific, detailed information you need
about each class. These are organized ac-
cording to groups. lnforrnation that applies
to the entire group is presented at the start of
the section. Each character class within the
group is then explained.
The descriptions use game terms that may
be unfamiliar to you; many of these are ex-
plained in this text (or you may look the
terms up in the Glossary).
Experience Points measure what a char-
acter has learned and how he has improved
his skill during the course of his adventures.
Characters eam experience points by com-
pleting adventures and by doing things spe-
cifically related to their class. A fighter, for
example, eams more experience for charg-
ing and battling a monster than does a thief,
because the fighters training emphasizes
battle while the Lhief's emphasizes stealth
and clevemess. Characters accumulate ex-
perience points from adventure to adven-
ture. When they accumulate enough, they
rise to the next level oi experience. gaining
additional abilities and powers. The experi-
ence level tables for each character group
list the total, accumulated experience points
needed to reach each level.
Some DMs may require that a character
spend a certain amount of time or money
training before rising to the next experi-
ence level. Your DM will tell you the re-
quiremenm for advancement when the
time comes.
level is a measure of the character's power.
A beginning character starts at 1st level. To ad-
vanoe to the next level, the character must
eam a requisite number of etperience points.
Different character dases improve at differ-
ent rates. Each increase in level improves the
character's survivability and skills.
Prime Requlsite is the ability score or
scores that are most important to a particu-
lar class. A fighter must be strong and a
mage must be intelligent; their prime requi-
sites, therefore, are Strength and Intelli-
gence. respectively. Some character classes
have more than one prime requisite. Any
character who has a score of 16 or more in
allhis prime requisites gains al0 percent bo-
nus to his experience point awards.
Warrior
The warrior group
encompasses the character classes of heroes
who make their way in the world primarily
by skill at arms: fighters, paladins, and
rangers.
Warriors are allowed to use any weapon.
They can wear any type of armor. Warriors
get 1 to 10 (1d1O) hit points per level and can
gain a special Constitution hit point bonus
that is available only to warriors.
The disadvantage warriors have is that
they are restricted in their selection of magi-
cal items and spells.
All warriors use Table 14 to deten-nine
their advancement in level as they eam ex-
perience points.
All warriors gain one 10-sided hit die per
level from 1st through 9th. After 9th level,
warriors gain just 3 hit points per level and
they no longer gain additional hit point bo-
nuses for high Constitution scores.

Ability Requirements: Strength 9
Prime Requisite: Strength
Allowed Races: All
The principal attribute of a fighter is
Strength. To become a fighter, a character
must have a minimum Strength score of 9.
A good Dexterity rating is highly desirable.
A ﬁghter who has a Strength score (his
prime requisite) of 16 or more gains a 10 per-
16
cent bonus to the azperience points he eams.
Also, high Strength gives the fighter a
better chance to hit an opponent and en-
ables him to cause more damage.

unique. A viﬁt to your loml librry can
uncovermanyheroicfightuers.
Fighters can have any alignment: good
or evil, lawful or chaotic, or neutral.
As a master of weapons, the fighter is the
only character able to have weapon speciali-
zation (explained in Chapter 5). Weapon
specialization enables the fighter to use a
particular weapon with exceptional skill,
improving his chances to hit and cause dam-
age with that weapon. A ﬁghter character is
not required to specialize in a weapon; the
choice is up to the player. No other charac-
ter class—not even ranger or paladin-—is al-
lowed weapon specialization.
While ﬁghters cannot cast magical spells,
they can use many magical items, including
potions, protection scrolls, most rings, and
all forms of enchanted armor, weapons, and
shields.
When a fighter attains 9th level (becomes
a "Lord"), he can automatically attract men-
at-arms. These soldiers, having heard of the
fighter, come for the chance to gain fame,
adventure, and cash. They are loyal as long
as they are well-treated, successful, and
paid well. Abusive treatment or a disastrous
campaign can lead to grumbling, desertion,
and possibly mutiny. To attract the men, the
tighter must have a castle or stronghold and
sizeable manor lands around it. As he
claims and niles this land. soldiers journey
to his domain, thereby increasing his power.
Furthermore, the fighter can tax and de-
velop these lands, gaining a steady income
from them. Your DM has information about
gaining and mnning a barony.
In addition to regular men-at-arrns, the
9th-level fighter also attracts an elite body-
guard (his "household guards"). Although
these soldiers are still mercenaries, they
have greater loyalty to their Lord than do
common soldiers. In retum, they expect bet-
ter treatment and more pay than the com-
mon soldier receives. Although the elite unit
can be chosen randomly, it is better to ask
your DM what unit your fighter attracts.
This allows him to choose a troop consistent
with the campaign.

Paladin
Ability Requirements: Strength 12
Constitution 9
Wisdom 13
Charisma 17
Prime Requisites: Strength,
Charisma
Races Allowed: Human
The paladin is a noble and heroic war-
riot, the symbol of all that is right and
true in the world. As such, he has high
ideals that he must maintain at all times.
Throughout legend and history there are
many heroes who could be called pala-
dins: Roland and the 12 Peers of Charle-
magne, Sir lancelot. Sir Gawain, and Sir
Galahad are all examples of the class.
However. many brave and heroic sol-
diers have tried and failed to live up to
the ideals of the paladin. It is not an easy
taskl
Only a human may become a paladin. He
must have minimum ability scores of
Strength 12, Constitution 9, Wisdom 13,
and Charisma 17. Strength and Charisma
are the prime requisites of the paladin. A
paladin must be lawful good in alignment
and must always remain lawful good. A
paladin who changes alignment, either
deliberately or inadvertently. loses all his
special powers—sometimes only temporari-
ly and sometimes forever. He can use any
weapon and wear any type of armor.
A paladin who has Strength and Cha-
risma scores of 16 or more gains a 10 percent
bonus to the experience points he earns.
Lawfulness and good deeds are the meat
and drink of a paladin. If a paladin ever
knowingly performs a chaotic act, he must
seek a high-level (7th or more) cleric of law-
ful good alignment, confess his sin, and do
Z1
penance as prescribed by the cleric. lf a pal-
adin should ever knowingly and willingly
perform an evil act, he loses the status of
paladinhood immediately and irrevocably.
All benefits are then lost and no deed or
magic can restore the character to pala-
dinhood: He is ever after a fighter. The
character's level remains unchanged when
this occurs and experience points are adiust-
ed accordingly. Thereafter the character is
bound by the rules for ﬁghters. He does not
gain the benefits of weapon specialization (if
this is used) since he did not select this for
his character at the start.
lf the paladin commits an evil act while
enchanted or controlled by magic, he loses
his paladin status until he can atone for the
deed. This loss of status means the character
loses all his special abilities and essentially
functions as a fighter (without weapon spe-
cialization) of the same level. Regaining his
status undoubtedly requires completion of
some dangerous quest or important mission
to once again prove his worth and assuage
his own guilt. He gains no experience prior
to or during the course of this mission. and
regains his standing as a paladin only upon
completing the quest.
A paladin has the following special bene-
fits:
A paladin can detect the presence of evil
intent up to 60 feet away by concentrating
on locating evil in a particular direction. He
can do this as often as desired, but each
attempt takes one round. This ability
detects evil monsters and characters.
A paladin receives a +2 bonus to all sav-
ing throws.
A paladin is immune to all forms of dis-
ease. (Note that certain magical afflic-
tions-—lycanthropy and mummy rot—are
curses and not diseases.)
A paladin can heal by laying on hands.
The paladin restores 2 hit points per experi-
ence level. He can heal himself or someone
else. but only once per day.
A paladin can cure diseases of all sorts
(though not cursed afflictions such as lycan-
thropy). This can be done only once per
week for each five levels of experience (once
per week at levels 1 through 5, twice per
week at levels 6 through 10, etc.).
A paladin is surrounded by an aura of
protection with a 10-foot radius. Within
this radius. all summoned and specifically
evil creatures suffer a -1 penalty to their
attack rolls. regardless of whom they
attack. Creatures affected by this aura can
spot its source easily, even if the paladin is
disguised.
A paladin using a holy sword projects a
circle of power 30 feet in diameter when the
sword is unsheathed and held. This power
dispels hostile magic of a level up to the pal-
adin's experience level. (A holy sword is a
very special weapon; if your paladin



Classes (Ranger)
‘I
acquires one, the DM will explain its other
powers.)
A paladin gains the power to turn
undead, devils, and demons when he reach-
es 3rd level. He affects these monsters the
same as does a cleric two levels lower—e.g.,
at 3rd level he has the tuming power of a
1st-level cleric. See the section on priests for
more details on this ability.
A paladin may call for his war horse upon
reaching 4th level, or anytime thereafter.
This faithful steed need not be a horse; it
may be whatever sort of creature is appro-
priate to the character (as decided by the
DM). A paladin's war horse is a very special
animal, bonded by fate to the warrior. The
paladin does not really “call” the animal,
nor does the horse instantly appear in front
of him. Rather, the character must find his
war horse in some memorable way, most
frequently by a specific quest.
A paladin can cast priest spells once he
reaches 9th level. He can cast only spells of
the combat, divination, healing, and pro-
tective spheres. (Spheres are explained in
the Priest section.) The acquisition and cast-
ing of these spells abide by the rules given
for priests.
The spell progression and casting level are
listed in Table 17. Unlike a priest, the pala-
din does not gain extra spells for a high Wis-
dom score. The paladin cannot cast spells
from clerical or dnridical scrolls nor can he
use priest items unless they are allowed to
the warrior group.

The following strictures apply to pala-
dins.
A paladin may not possess more than 10
magical items. Furthermore, these may not
exceed one suit of armor, one shield, four
weapons (arrows and bolts are not count-
ed), and four other magical items.
A paladin never retains wealth. He may
keep only enough treasure to support him-
self in a modest manner, pay his henchmen,
men-at-an-ns, and servitors a reasonable
rate. and to construct or maintain a small
castle or keep (funds can be set aside for this
purpose). All excess must be donated to the
church or another worthy cause. This
money can never be given to another player
character or NFC controlled by a player.
A paladin must tithe to whatever charita-
ble, religious institution of lawful good
alignment he serves. A tithe is 10 percent of
the paladins income, whether coins, jewels,
magical items, W385. rewards, or taxes. lt
must be paid immediately.
A paladin does not attract a body of fol-
lowers upon reaching 9th level or building a
castle. However, he can still hire soldiers
and specialists. although these men must be
lawful good in compartment.
A paladin may employ only lawful good
henchmen (or those who act in such a man-
ner when alignment is unknoum). A paladin
will cooperate with characters of other
alignments only as long as they behave
themselves. He will try to show them the
proper way to live through both word and
deed. The paladin realizes that most people
simply cannot maintain his high standards.
Even thieves can be tolerated, provided they
are not evil and are sincerely trying to
reform. He will not abide the company of
those who commit evil or unrighteous acts.
Stealth in the cause of good is acceptable,
though only as a last resort.

The ranger must have scores not less than
13 in Strength, 14 in Constitution, 13 in
Dexterity, and 14 in Wisdom. The prime
requisites of the ranger are Strength, Dex-
terity, and Wisdom. Rangers are always
good, but they can be lawful, neutral, or
chaotic. lt is in the ranger's heart to do good,
but not always by the rules.
A ranger who has Strength, Dexterity.
and Wisdom scores of 16 or more gains a 10
percent bonus to the experience points he
eams.
Although the ranger can use any weapon
and wear any armor, several of his special
abilities are usable only when he is wearing
studded leather or lighter armor.
Although he has the basic skills of a war-
rior, the ranger also has several advantages.
When wearing studded leather or lighter
armor, a ranger can fight two-handed with
no penalty to his attack rolls (see page 96).
Obviously, the ranger cannot use a shield
when fighting this way. A ranger can still
fight with two weapons while wearing
heavier armor than studded leather, but he
suffers the standard attack roll penalties.
The ranger is a skilled woodsman. Even if
the optional proficiency rules are not used,
the ranger has Tracking proﬁciency. If the
proficiency rules are used in your campaign.
the ranger knows Tracking without expend-
ing any points. Furthermore, this skill

Class
improves by +1 for every three levels the
ranger has eamed (3rd to 5th level, + 1; 6th
to 8t.h level, +2. etc.). While wearing stud-
ded leather or lighter armor, the ranger can
try to move silently and hide in shadows.
His chance to succeed in natural surround-
ings is given on Table 18 (modified by the
ranger's race and Dexterity, as given on Ta-
bles 27 and Z8 on page 39)- When attempt-
ing these actions in non-natural
surroundings (a musty crypt or city streets)
the chance of success is halved. Hiding in
shadows and moving silently are not possi-
ble in any armor heavier than studded
leather—the armor is inflexible and makes
too much noise.
in their roles as protectors of good, rang-
ers tend to focus their efforts against some
particular creature, usually one that ma-
rauds their homeland. Before advancing to
Znd level, every ranger must select a species
enemy. Typical enemies include giants.
orcs, lizard men, trolls, or ghouls; your DM
has final approval on the choice. Thereafter,
whenever the ranger encounters that enemy,
he gains a +4 bonus to his attack rolls. This
enmity can be concealed only with great dif-
ficulty, so the ranger suffers a - 4 penalty on
all encounter reactions with creatures of the
hated type. Furthermore, the ranger will ac-
tively seek out this enemy in combat in pref-
erence to all other foes unless someone else
presents a much greater danger.
Rangers are adept with both trained and
untamed creatures, having a limited degree
of animal empathy. lf a ranger carefully ap-
proaches or tends any natural animal, he
can try to modify the animal's reactions. (A
natural animal is one that can be found in
the real world -—a bear, snake, zebra, etc.)
When dealing with domestic or non-
hostile animals, a ranger can approach the
animal and befriend it automatically. He
can easily discem the qualities of the crea-
ture (spotting the best horse in the corral or
seeing that the runt of the litter actually has
great promise).
When dealing with a wild animal or an
animal trained to attack, the animal must
roll a saving throw vs. rods to resist the
ranger's overtures. (This table is used even
though the ranger's power is non-magical.)
The ranger imposes a -1 penalty on the die
roll for every three experience levels he has
earned (-1 at 1st to 3rd, -2 at 4th to 6th,
etc.). lf the creature fails the saving throw,
its reaction can be shifted one category as
the ranger chooses. Of course, the ranger
must be at the front of the party and must
approach the creature fearlessly.
For example, Beomhelm, a 7th-level
‘anger, is leading his friends through the
/voods. On entering a clearing, he spots a
1ungry black bear blocking the path on the
ather side. Signaling his friends to wait,
komhelm approaches the beast, whisper-
ng soothing words. The DM rolls a saving
throw vs. rods for the bear, modified by -3
for Beornhelm's level. The bear's normal re-
action is unfriendly, but Beoi-nhelrn‘s pres-
ence reduces this to neutral. The party waits
patiently until the bear wanders off to seek
its dinner elsewhere.
Later. Beomhelm goes to the horse market
to get a new mount. The dealer shows him a
spirited horse, notorious for being vicious and
stubbom. Beornhelm approaches it mrefully,
again speaking soothingly, and mounts the
stallion with no difficulty. Ridden by
Beomhelm, the horse is spirited but well-
behaved. Approached by anyone else, the
horse reverts to its old ways.
A ranger can learn priest spells, but only
those of the plant or animal spheres (see
page 34), when he reaches 8th level (see Ta-
ble 18). He gains and uses his spells accord-
ing to the rules given for priests (see page
32). He does not gain bonus spells for a high
Wisdom score, nor is he ever able to use
clerical scrolls or magical items unless spe-
cifically noted otherwise.
Rangers can build castles, forts, or
strongholds, but do not gain any special fol-
lowers by doing so.
At 10th level, a ranger attracts 2d6 fol-
lowers. These followers might be normal
humans, but they are often animals or even
stranger denizens of the land. Table 19 can
be used to determine these, or your DM
may assign specific followers.

Of course, your DM can assign particular
creatures, either choosing from the list
above or from any other source. He can also
nile that certain creatures are not found in
the regiOl'\—it is highly unlikely that a tiger
would come wandering through a territory
similar to western Europel
These followers arrive over the course of
several months. Often they are encountered
during the ranger's adventures (allowing
you and your DM a chance to role-play the
initial meeting). While the followers are au-
tomatically loyal and friendly toward the
ranger, their future behavior depends on the
ranger's treatment of them. in all cases, the
ranger does not gain any special method of
communicating with his followers. He must
either have some way of speaking to them
or they simply mutely accompany him on
his ioumeys. ("Yeah this bears been with
me for years. Don't know why—he just
seems to follow me around. ldon't own him
and can't tell him to do anything he don’!
want to do/'snid the grizzled old woodsman
sitting outside the tavern.)
Of course, the ranger is not obligated to
take on followers. if he prefers to remain in-
dependent, he can release his followers at
any time. They reluctantly depart, but
stand ready to answer any call for aid he
might put out at a later time.
Like the paladin, the ranger has a code of
behavior.
A ranger must always retain his good
alignment. if the ranger intentionally com-
mits an evil act, he automatically loses his
ranger status. Thereafter he is considered a
fighter of the same level (if he has more ex-
perience points than a ﬁghter of his level, he
loses all the excess experience points). His
ranger status can never be regained. if the
ranger involuntarily commits an evil act
(perhaps in a situation of no choice), he can-
not eam any more experience points until he
has cleansed himself of that evil. This can be
accomplished by correcting the wrongs he
committed, revenging himself on the person
who forced him to commit the act, or releas-
ing those oppressed by evil. The ranger in-
stinctively knows what things he must do to
regain his status (i.e., the DM creates a spe-
cial adventure for the character).
Furthennore, rangers tend to be loners,
men constantly on the move. They cannot
have henchmen, hirelings, mercenaries, or
even servants until they reach 8th level.
While they can have any monetary amount
of treasure. they cannot have more treasure
than they can carry. Excess treasure must ei-
ther be converted to a portable form or do-
nated to a worthy institution (an NPC
group, not a player character).



l
Wizard
The wizard group
encompasses all spelloasters working ir\ the
various ﬁelds of magic—both those who spe-
cialize in specific schools of magic and those
who study a broad range of magical theories.
Spending their lives in pursuit of arcane wis-
dom, wizards have little time for physical
endeavors. They tend to be poor ﬁghters with
little knowledge of weaponry. However. they
command powerful and dangerous energies
with a few simple gestures, rare components,
and mystical words.
Spells are the tools, weapons, and armor
of the wizard. He is weak in a toe-to-toe
fight, but when prepared he can strike down
his foes at a distance, vanish in an instant,
become a wholly different creature, or even
invade the mind of an enemy and take con-
trol of his thoughts and actions. No secrets
are safe from a wiurd and no fortress is
secure. His quest for knowledge and power
often leads him into realms where mortals
were never meant to go.
Wizards cannot wear any armor, for several
remons. Firstly, most spells require complimted
gestures and odd posturing by the caster and
armor restricts the wearer's ability to do these
properly. Secondly, the wizard spent his youth
(and will spend most of his life) leaming arcane
languags, poring through old books, and prac-
tidng his spells. This leaves no time for leaming
othu thin§ (like how to wear armor properly
and use it effectively). lf the wizard had qaent
his time leaming about armor. he would not
have even the meager skills and powers he
bq5mwith. There areevm unfounded theories
that claim the materials in most armors disrupt
thedelioate fabric of a spell as it gathers energy;
the two annot etdst side by side in harmony.
While this idea is popular with the common
people, true wizards know this is simply not
true. If it were, how would they ever be able to
cast spells requiring iron braziers or metal
bowls?
For similar reasons, wizards are severely
restricted in the weapons they can use. They
are limited to those that are easy to learn or are
sometimes useful in their ow'n research.
Henceawizardcanuseadaggerorastaff.
items that are traditionally useful in magical
studies. Other weapons allowed are darts,
knives, and slinp (weapons that require little
skill, little strength, or both).
Wizards can use more magical items than
any other characters. These include
potions, rings, wands, rods, scrolls, and
most miscellaneous magical items. A wizard
can use a magical version of any weapon
allowed to his class but cannot use magical
armor, because no armor is allowed.
Between their spells and magical items.
however, wizards wield great power.
Finally, all wizards (whether mages or spe-
cialists) can create new magical items, ranging
from simple strolls and potions to powerful
staves and magic swords. Once he reaches 9th
level, a wizard can pen magical scrolls and
brew potions. He can construct more power-
ful rnagical items only after he has learned the
appropriate spells (or works with someone
who knows them). Your DM should consult
the Spell Research and Magical items sections
of the DMG for more information.
No matter what school of magic the wiz-
ard is involved in, intelligence is his prime
requisite (or one of several prime requi-
sites). Characters must have an intelligence
score of at least 9 to qualify to be a wizard.
All wizards use Table Z0 to determine
their advancement in level as they eam
experience points. They also use Table 21 to
determine the levels and numbers of spells
they can cast at each experience level.
All wizards gain one four-sided Hit Die
(1d4) per level from 1st through 10th levels.
After 10th level, wizards enm 1 hit point per
level and they no longer gain additional hit
point bonuses for high Constitution scores.

Leaming and casting spells require long
study, patience, and research. Once his
adventuring life begins, a wizard is largely
responsible for his own education; he no
longer has a teacher looking over his shoul-
der and telling him which spell to leam next.
This freedom is not without its price, how-
ever. It means that the wizard must find his
own source for magical knowledge:
libraries, guilds, or captured books and
scrolls.
Whenever a wizard discovers instructions
for a spell he doesn't know, he can try to
read and understand the instructions. The
player must roll percentile dice. if the result
is equal to or less than the percentage chance
to learr\ a new spell (listed on Table 4, page
16), the character understands the spell
30
and how to cast it. He can enter the spell in
his spell book (unless he has already learned
the maximum number of spells allowed for
that level). lf this die roll is higher than the
character's chance to learn the spell, he
doesn't understand the spell. Once a spell is
learned. it cannot be unleamed. ll remains
part of that characters repertoire forever.
Thus a character cannot choose to "forget" a
spell so as to replace it with another.
A Wizard's spell book can be a single
book, a set of books, a bundle of scrolls, or
anything else your DM allows. The spell
hook is the Wizard's diary, laboratory jour-
nal, and encyclopedia, containing a record
of everything he knows. Naturally, it is his
most treasured possession; without it he is
almost helpless.



A spell book contains the complicated
instructions for casting the spell—the spell's
‘recipe, so to speak. Merely reading these
instructions aloud or trying to mimic the
instructions does not enable one to cast the
spell. Spells gather and shape mystical ener-
gies; the procedures involved are very
demanding, bizarre, and intricate. Before a
wizard can actually cast a spell, he must
memorize its arcane formula. This locks an
energy pattern for that particular spell into
his mind. Once he has the spell memorized,
it remains in his memory until he uses the
exact combination of gestures, words, and
materials that triggers the release of this
energy pattern. Upon casting, the energy of
the spell is spent, wiped clean from the wiz-
ard's mind. The wizard cannot cast that
well again until he returns to his spell book
and memorizs it again.
initially the wizard is able to retain only a
few of these magical energies in his mind at
one time. Furthermore, some spells are
more demanding and complex than others;
these are impossible for the inexperienced
wizard to memorize. With experience, the
wizard’: talent expands. He can memorize
more spells and more complex spells. Still,
he never escapes his need to study; the wiz-
ard must always return to his spell books to
refresh his powers.
Another important power of the wizard is
his ability to research new spells and con-
struct magical items. Both endeavors are
difficult, time-consuming, costly, occasion-
ally even perilous. Through research, a wiz-
ard can create an entirely new spell, subject
to the DM's approval.  by consult-
ing with your DM, your character can build
magical items, either similar to those
already given in the nrles or of your own
design. Your DM has information concem-
ing spell research and magical item creation.

Mages are the most versatile types of wiz-
arrb, those who choose not to specialize in
any single school of magic. This is both an
advantage and a disadvantage. On the posi-
tive side, the mage's selection of spells
enables him to deal with many different sit-
uations. (Wiurds who study within a single
school of magic learn highly specialized
spells, but at the expense of spells from oth-
er areas.) The other side of the coin is that
the mage’s ability to leam specialized spells
is limited compared to the specialist's.
Mages have no historical coiuiterparts;
they exist only in legend and myth.
However, players can model their char-
acters after such legendary figures as
Merlin, Ciroe, or Medea. Accounts of
powerful wizards and soroeresses are
rare, since their reputations are based in
nosmallpa.rtont.hemysterythataur-
rounds them. These legendary ﬁgures
worked toward secret ends, seldom con-
fiding in the normal folk around them.
A mage who has an intelligence score of
16 or higher gains a 10 percent bonus to the
experience points he earns.
The Schools of Magic
Spells are divided
into nine different categories, or schools,
according to the types of magical energy
they utilize. Each school has its own special
methods and practica.
Although they are called schools, schools
of magic are not organized places where a
person goes to study. The word "school"
identifies a magical discipline. A school is
an approach to magic and spellcasting that
emphasizes a particular sort of spell. Practi-
tioners of a school of magic may set up a
magical university to teach their methods to
beginners, but this is not necessary. Many
powerful wizards leamed their craft study-
ing under reclusive masters in distant lands.
The nine schools of magic are Abluration,
Alteration, Conluration/Summoning, En-
chantmentlCharrn, Greater Divination, illu-
sion, lnvocation/Evocation, Necromancy,
and Lesser Divination.

This diagram illustrates the schools that
oppose each other. See Table 22 and its entry
descriptions for more information.
Of these schools, eight are greater schools
while the ninth, lesser divination, is a minor
school. The minor school of lesser divina-
tion includes all divination spells of the 4th
spell level or less (available to all wizards).
Greater divinations are those divination
spells of the 5th spell level or higher.
Specialist Wizards
A wizard who concentrates his effort in a
single school of magic is called a specialist.
There are specialists in each type of magic,
although some are extremely rare. Not all
specialists are well-suited to adventuring-
the diviner's spells are limited and not gener-
ally useful in dangerous situations. On the
other hand, player characters might want to
consult an NPC diviner before starting an
adventure.
Specialist wizards have advantages and
disadvantages when compared to mages.
Their chance to know spells of their school
of magic is greatly inueased, but the inten-
sive study results in a smaller chance to
know spells outside their school. The num-
ber of spells they can cast increases, but they
lose the ability to cast spells of the school in
opposition to their specialty (opposite it in
the diagram). Their ability to research and
create new spells within their specialty is
increased, but the initial selection of spells
in their school may be quite limited. All in
all, players must consider the advantages
and disadvantages carefully.
Not all wizards can become 
The player character must meet certain
requirements to become a specialist. Most
specialist wizards must be single-classed;
multi-classed characters cannot become
specialists, except for gnomes, who seem to
have more of a natural bent for the school of
illusion than characters of any other race.
Dual-class humans can choose to become
specialists. The dedication to the particular
school of magic requires all the attention
and concentration of the character. He does
not have time for other class-related pur-
suits.

Classes (Illusionist)
ln addition, each school has different
restrictions on race, ability scores, and
schools of magic allowed. These restrictions
are given on Table Z2. Note that lesser divi-
nation is not available as a specialty. The
spells of this group, vital to the functioning
of a wizard, are available to all wizards.
Race lists those races that, either through
a natural tendency or a quirk of fate, are
allowed to specialize in that art. Note that
the gnome, though unable to be a regular
mage, can specialize in illusions.
Minimum Ability score lists the ability
minimums needed to study intensively in
that school. All schools require at least the
minimum Intelligence demanded of a mage
and an additional prime requisite, as listed.
Opposition $cl|ool(s) always includes the
school directly opposite the character's
school of study in the diagram on page 31.
In addition, the schools to either side of this
one may also be disallowed due to the
nature of the character's school. For exam-
ple, an invoker/evoker cannot learn
enchantment/charm or coniurationl
summoning spells and cannot use magical
items that duplicate spells from these
schools.
Being a specialist does have significant
advantages to balance the trade-offs the
character must make. These are listed here:
’ A specialist gains one additional spell
per spell level, provided the additional spell
is taken in the specialists school. Thus a 1st-
level illusionist could have two spells—one
being any spell he knows and the other lim-
ited to spells of the illusion school.
' Because spedalists have an enhanced
understanding of spells within their school,
they receive a + 1 bonus when making sav-
ing throws against those spells when cast by
other wizards. Likewise, other characters
suffer a -1 penalty when making saving
throws against a specialist casting spells
within his school. Both of these modiﬁers
can be in effect at the same ti.me—e.g., when
an enc.hanter casts an enchantment spell at
another enchanter, the modifiers cancel
each other out.
' Specialists receive a bonus of +15 per-
cent when learning spells from their school
and a penalty of -15 percent when learning
spells from other schools. The bonus or pen-
alty is applied to the percentile dice roll the
player must make when the character tries
to learn a new spell (see Table 4).
' Whenever a specialist reaches a new
spell level, he automatically gains one spell
of his school to add to his spell books. This
spell can be selected by the DM or he can
allow the player to pick. No roll for learning
the spell need be made. It is assumed that the
character has discovered this new spell dur-
ing the course of his research and study.
' When a specialist wizard attempts to
create a new spell (using the rules given in
the DMG), the DM should count the new
spell as one level less (for determining the
difficulty) if the spell falls within the school
of the specialist. An enchanter attempting to
create a new enchantment spell would have
an easier time of it than an illusionist
attempting to do the same.

Prime Requisite: lntelligence

The illusionist is an example of a special-
ist. The description of the illusionist given
here can be used as a guide for creating wiz-
ards specializing in other magical schools.
First, the school of illusion is a very
demanding field of study. To specialize as an
illusionist, a wizard needs a Dexterity score
of at least 16.
An illusionist who has an Intelligence of
16 or more gains a 10 percent bonus to the
experience points he earns.
Because the illusionist knows far more
about illusions than the standard wizard, he
is allowed a +1 bonus when rolling saving
throws against illusions; other characters
suffer a -1 penalty when rolling saving
throws against his illusions. (These modi-
fiers apply only if the spell allows a saving
throw.)
Through the course of his studies, the illu-
sionist has become adept at memorizing illu-
sion spells (though it is still an arduous
process). He can memorize an extra illusion
spell at each spell level. Thus as a 1st-level
caster he can memorize two spells, although
at least one of these must be an illusion spell .
Later, when he begins to research new
spells for his collection, he finds it easier to
devise new illusion spells to fill specialized
needs. Research in other schools is harder
and more time consuming for him.
Finally, the intense study of illusion magic
prevents the character from mastering the
other classes of spells that are totally alien to
the illusion school (those diametrically
opposite illusion on the diagram). Thus, the
illusionist cannot leam spells from the
schools of necromancy, invocation/evo-
cation, or abj_uration.
As an example, consider loinville the illu-
sionist. He has an Intelligence score of 15. ln
the course of his travels he captures an en-
emy wizard's spell book that contains an im-
proved invisibility spell, a continua! light
spell, and a fireball spell, none of which are
in Joinville's spell book. He has an 80 per-
cent chance to learn the improved invisibil-
ity spell. Continual light is an alteration
spell, however, so his chance to learn it is
only 50 percent (consult Table 4 to see where
these figures come from). He cannot leam
the ﬁreball spell. or even transcribe it into
his spell book, because it is an evocation
spell.

The priest is a be-
liever and advocate of a god from a particu-
lar mythos. More than iust a follower, he
intercedes and acts on behalf of others,
seeking to use his powers to advance the
beliefs of his mythos.
All priests have certain powers: The abil-
ity to cast spells, the strength of arm to
defend their beliefs. and special, deity-
granted powers to aid them in their calling.
While priests are not as ﬁerce in combat as
warriors, they are trained to use weaponry
in the fight for their cause. They can cast
spells, primarily to further their god's aims



and protect its adherents. They have few of-
fersive spells, but these are very powerful.
All priests use eight—sided Hit Dice (d8sl.
Only priests gain additional spells for hav-
ing high Wisdom scores. All priests have a
limited selection of weapons and armor, but
the restrictions vary according to the my-
thos.
All priests use Table 23 to determine their
advancement in level as they gain experi-
ence points. They also all use Table 24 to de-
termine how many spells they receive at
each level of experience.
All priest spells are divided into 16 cate-
gories called spheres of inﬂuence. Different
types of priests have access to different
spheres; no priest can cast spells from every
sphere of influence. The 16 spheres of influ-
ence are as follows: All, Animal, Astral,
Charm, Combat, Creation, Divination, Ele-
mental, Guardian, Healing, Necromantic,
Plant. Protection, Summoning, Sun, and
Weather (see page 34).
l.n addition, a priest has either major or
minor access to a sphere. A priest with ma-
jor access to a sphere can (eventually) cast
all spells in the sphere. A priest with minor
access to a sphere can cast only 1st-. 2nd-,
and 3rd-level spells from that sphere.
All priests gain one eight-sided Hit Die
(1cl8) per level from 1st through 9th. After
9th level, priests eum 2 hit points per level
and they no longer gain additional hit point
bonuses for high Constitution scores.

“ Usable only by priests with 18 or

Clerk
Ability Requirement; Wisdom 9
Prime Requisite: Wisdom
Races Allowed: All
The most common type of priest is the
cleric. The cleric may be an adherent of any
religion (though if the DM designs a specific
mythos, the cleric's abilities and spells may
be changed—see following). Clerics are gen-
erally good, but are not restricted to good;
they can have any alignment acceptable to
their order. A cleric must have a Wisdom
score of 9 or more. High Constitution and
Charisma are also particularly useful.
A cleric who has a Wisdom of 16 or more
gains a 10 percent bonus to the experience
points he eams.
The cleric class is similar to certain reli-
gious orders of knighthood of the Middle
Ages; the Teutonic Knights, the Knights
Templars, and Hospltalers. These orders
combined military and religious training
with a code of protection and service.
Meutbemwerehainedaskniglitsandde
voted themselves to the service of the
church. These orders were frequently
found on the outer edges of the Chriltlan
world, either on the fringe of the wilder-
nas or in war-tom lands. Archbishop
Turpin (of The Song of Roland) is an ex-
ample of suchacleric. Similarorderscan
also be found in other lands, such as the
sohei of Japan.

'\ H3,
Classes (Cleric) 
Clerics are sturdy soldiers. although their
selection of weapons is limited. They can
wear any type of armor and use any shield.
Standard clerics. being reluctant to shed
blood or spread violence, are allowed to use
only blunt. bludgeoning weapons. They can
use a fair number of magical items including
clerical scrolls, most potions and rings,
some wands and rods, staves, armor,
shields, and magical versions of any weap-
ons allowed by their order.
Spells are the main tools of the cleric,
however, helping him to serve, fortify, pro-
tect, and revitalize those under his care. He
has a wide variety of spells to ChOose from.
suitable to many different purposes and
needs. (A priest of a specific mythos proba-
bly has a more restricted range of spells-
see page 34.) A cleric has major access to
every sphere of influence except the plant.
animal, weather, and elemental spheres (he
has minor access to the elemental sphere
and cannot cast spells of the other three
spheres).
The cleric receives his spells as insight di-
rectly from his deity (the deity does not need
to make a personal appearance to grant the
spells the cleric prays for), as a sign of and
reward for his faith, so he must take care not
to abuse his power lest it be taken away as
punishment.
The cleric is also granted power over
undead—evil creatures that exist in a fonn
of non-life, neither dead nor alive. The
deric is charged with defeating these mock-
eries of life. His ability to mm undead (see
page 103) enables him to drive away these
creatures or destroy them utterly (though a
cleric of evil alignment can bind the crea-
tures to his will). Some of the more common
undead creatures are ghosts, zombies. skele-
tons, ghouls, and mummies. Vampires and
liches (undead sorcerers) are two of the
most powerful undead.
As a cleric advancs in level, he gains addi-
tional spells, better combat skills, and a
stronger tuming ability. Upon reaching 8th
level, the cleric automatically attracts a fanati-
cally loyal group of believers, provided the
character has established a place of worship of
significant size. The cleric can build this place
of worship at any time during his career, but
he does not attract believers until he reaches
8th level. These followers are normal war-
riors, Oth-level soldiers, ready to fight for the
clerids cause. The cleric attracts 20 to 200 of
these followers; they arrive over a period of
several weeks. After the initial followers as-
semble, no new followers trickle in to fill the
ranks of those who have fallen in service. The
DM decides the exact number and types of fol-
lowers attracted by the deric. The character
can hire other troops as needed, but thee are
not as loyal as his followers.
. At 9th level, the cleric may receive official
approval to establish a religious stronghold,
be it a fortified abbey or a secluded convent.



’<_l/'
Obviously, the stronghold must contain all
the trappings of a place of worship and must
be dedicated to the service of the cleric's
cause. However, the construction cost of the
stronghold is half the normal price. since the
work has official sanction and much of the
labor is donated. The cleric can hold prop-
erty and build a stronghold anytime before
reaching 9th level, but this is done without
church sanction and does not receive the
benefits described above.
Priests of Speclﬂc Mythol
ln the simplest ver-
sion of the AD&D@ game, clerics senre reli-
gions that can be generally described as
"good" or "evil." Nothing more needs to be
said about it; the game will play perfectly
well at this level. However, a DM who has
taken the time to create a detailed campaign
World has often spent some of that time de-
vising elaborate pantheons, either unique
creations or adaptations from history or lit-
erature. If the option is open (and only your
DM can decide), you may want your char-
acter to adhere to a particular mythos, tak-
ing advantage of the detail and color your
DM has provided. lf your character follows
a particular mythos, expect him to have
abilities, spells, and restrictions different
from the generic cleric.
Priesthood in any mythos must be de-
fined in five categories: requirements,
weapons allowed, spells allowed, granted
powers, and ethos.
Requirements
Before a character can become a priest of
a particular mythos. certain requirements
must be met. These usually involve mini-
mum ability scores and mandatory align-
ments. All priests, regardless of mythos,
must have Wisdom scores of at least 9. Be-
yond this, your DM can set other require-
ments as needed. A god of battle, for
example, should require strong, healthy
priests (13 Str. 12 Con). One whose sphere is
art and beauty should demand high Wis-
dom and Charisma (16 or better). Most dei-
ties demand a specific type of behavior from
their followers. and this will dictate align-
ment choices.
Weapons Allowed
Not all mythoi are opposed to the shed-
ding of blood. lndeed. some require their
priests to use swords, spears, or other spe-
cific weapons, A war deity might allow his
priests to fight with spears or swords. An
agricultural deity might emphasize weapons
derived from farm implements—sickles and
bills, for example. A deity of peace and har-
mony might grant only the simplest and
least harmful weapons—perhaps only las-
soes and nets. Given below are some sug-
gested weapons, but many more are

in this matter).

Of course there are many other reasons a
deity might be associated with a particular
weapon or group of weapons. These are of-
ten cultural, reﬂecting the weapons used by
the people of the area, There may be a par-
ticular legend associated with the deity, ty-
ing it to some powerful artifact weapon
(Thor's hammer. for example). The DM has
the final choice in all situations.
Spells Allowed
A priest of a particular mythos is allowed
to cast spells from only a few, related
spheres. The priest's deity will have major
and minor accesses to certain spheres, and
this determines the spells available to the
priest, (Each deity's access to spheres is de-
termined by the DM as he creates the pan-
theon of his world.) The 16 spheres of
influence are defined in the following para-
graphs.
A priest whose deity grants major access
to a sphere can choose from any spell within
that sphere (provided he is high enough in
level to cast it), while one allowed only mi-
nor access to the sphere is limited to spells of
3rd level or below in that sphere. The com-
bination of major and minor accesses to
spheres results in a wide variation in the
spells available to priests who worship dif-
ferent deities.
All refers to spells usable by any priest,
regardless of mythos. There are no Powers
(deities) Of the Sphere of All. This group in-
cludes spells the priest needs to perform ba-
sic functions.
Animal spells are those that affect or alter
creatures. lt does not include spells that af-
lect people. Deities of nature and husbandry
typically operate in this sphere.
Astral is a small sphere of spells that
enable movement or communication be-
tween the different planes of existence. The
34
masters of a plane or particularly meddle-
some Powers often grant spells from this
sphere.
Charm spells are those that affect the atti-
tudes and actions of people. Deities of love.
beauty, trickery. and art often allow access
to this sphere.
Combat spells are those that can be used
to directly attack or harm the enemies of the
priest or his mythos. These are often
granted by deities of war or death.
Creation spells enable the priest to pro-
duce something from nothing. often to ben-
efit his followers, This sphere can fill many
different roles. from a provider to a trick-
ster.
Divination enables the priest to leam the
safest course of action in a particular situa-
tion, find a hidden item, or recover long-
forgotten information. Deities of wisdom
and knowledge typically have access to this
sphere.
Elemental spells are all those that affect
the four basic elements of creation—earth.
air, fire, and water. Nature deities, elemen-
tal deities. those representing or protecting
various crafts, and the deities of sailors
would all draw spells from this sphere.
Guardian spells place magical sentries over
an item or person. These spells are more active
than protection spells because they create an
actual guardian creature of some type. Pro-
tective, healing, and trickster deities may all
grant spells of this sphere.
Healing spells are those that cure dis-
eases, remove afflictions, or heal wounds.
These spells cannot restore life or regrow
lost limbs. Healing spells can be reversed to
cause injury, but such use is restricted to evil
priests. Protective and merciful deities are
most likely to grant these spells, while na-
ture deities may have lesser access to them.
Necromantic spells restore to a creature
some element of its life-force that has been
totally destroyed. lt might be life, a limb, or
an experience level. These spells in reverse
are powerfully destructive. and are used
only by extremely evil priests. Deities of life
or death are most likely to act in this sphere.
Plant spells affect plants. ranging from
simple agriculture (improving crops and the
like) to communicating with plant-like crea-
tures. Agricultural and nature Powers grant
spells in this sphere.
Protection spells create mystical shields
to defend the priest or his charges from evil
attacks. War and protective deities are most
likely to use these, although one devoted to
mercy and kindness might also bestow these
spells.
Summoning spells serve to call creatures
from other places, or even other dimen-
sions, to the service of the priest. Such serv-
ice is often against the will of the creature,
so casting these spells often involves great
risk. Since creatures summoned often cause



great hann and destruction, these spells are
sometimes bestowed by war or death
powers.
Sun spells are those dealing in the basic
powers of the solar universe—the purity of
light and its counterpart darkness. Sun
spells are very common with nature, agri-
cultural, or life-giving powers.
Weather spells enable the priest to manip-
ulate the forces of weather. Such manipula-
tion can be as simple as providing rain to
parched fields, or as complex as unbridling
the power of a raging tempest. Not surpris-
ingly. these tend to be the province of nature
and agricultural powers and appear in the
repertoire of sea and ocean powers.
Additional spheres can be created by
your DM. The listed spheres are typical of
the areas in which deities concentrate their
interest and power. Spells outside the deity's
major and minor spheres of inﬂuence are
not available to its priests.
Furthennore, the priest can obtain his
spells at a faster or slower pace than the nor-
mal cleric. Should the character‘s ethos
place emphasis on self-reliance, the spell
progression is slower. Those deities associ-
ated with many amazing and wondrous
events might grant more spells per level. Of
course, your DM has final say on this, and
he must balance the gain or loss of spells
against the other powers, abilities, and re-
strictions of the character.
Granted Powers
Another aspect of a specific mythos is the
special powers available to its priests. The
cleric's granted power is the ability to tum
undead. This ability, however, is not com-
mon to all priests. Other deities grant
powers in accordance with their spheres. lf
your DM is using a specific mythos, he must
decide what power is granted to your priest.
Some possible suggestions are given below.
" Incite Berserker Rage, adding a +2 bo-
nus to attack and damage rolls (War).
' Soothing Word, able to remove fear and
influence hostile reactions (Peace, Mercy,
Healing).
' Charm or Fascination, which could act
as a suggestion spell (Love, Beauty, Art).
' Inspire Fear, radiating an aura of fear
similar to the fear spell (Death).
These are only a few of the granted
powers that might be available to a charac-
ter. As with allowed weapons, much de-
pends on the culture of the region and the
tales and legends surrounding the Power
and its priests.
Ethos
All priests must live by certain tenets and
beliefs. These guide the priests’ behavior.
Clerics generally try to avoid shedding
blood and try to aid their community. A
war deity may order its priests to be at the
forefront of battles and to actively crusade
against all enemies. A harvest deity may
want its priests to be active in the fields. The
ethos may also dictate what alignment the
priest must be. The nature of the mythos
helps define the strictures the priest must
follow.
Priest Titles
Priests of differing mythoi often go by ti-
tles and names other than priest. A priest of
nature. for example (especially one based on
Western European tradition) could be called
a druid (see this page). Shamans and witch
doctors are also possibilities. A little library
research will turn up many more unique and
colorful titles, a few of which are listed here:
Abbess, Abbot, Ayatollah. Bonze.
Brother, Dom, Eye of the Law, Friar,
Guru, Haiji, imam, Mendicant, Metro-
politan, Mullah, Pardoner, Patriarch,
Prelate, Prior, Qadi, Rector, Vicar, and
Yogi
Balancing It All
When creating a priest of a specific my-
thos, careful attention must be given to the
balance of the character's different abilities.
A priest strong in one area or having a wide
range of choice must be appropriately weak-
ened in another area so that he does not be
come too powerful compared to the other
priests in the pme. If a war deity allows a
priest the use of all weapons and armor, the
character should be limited in the spells al-
lowed or powers granted. At the other ex-
treme, a character who follows a deity of
peace should have significant spells and
granted powers to make up for his extremely
limited or nonexistent choice of weapons. A
druid, for example, has more granted powers
than a normal cleric to compensate for his
limited annor and spell selection.
Druid
Ability Requirements: Wisdom 12
Charisma 15
Prime Requisites: Wisdom, Charisma
Races Allowed: Human, Half-elf
Historically, druids lived among theGer-
manic tribes of Western Europe and Brit-
ain during the days of the Roman
Enpire. They acted as advisonr to chief-
tains and held great influence over the
tribesmen. Central to their thinking was
thebeliefthattlieearthwastliemother
and source of all life. They revered many
natural t.hings—the sun, moon, and oer-
tain tree:—as deities. Druids in the
AD&D' game, however, are only
loosely patterned after these historical
ﬁgures. They are not required to behave
like or follow the beliefs of historical
druids.
35
Classes (Druid) 
The druid is an example of a priest de-
signed for a spedfic mythos. His powers
and beliefs are different from those of the
cleric. The dniid is a priest of nature and
guardian of the wildemess. be it forest.
plains, or jungle.
Requirements
A druid must be human or half-elven. He
must have a Wisdom score of at least 12 and
a Charisma score of 15 or more. Both of
these abilities are prime requisites.
Weapons Allowed
Unlike the cleric, the druid is allowed to
use only "natural" armors—leather armor
and wooden shields, including those with
magical enhancements. All other armors are
forbidden to him. His weapons are limited
to club, sickle, dart, spear, dagger, scimitar,
sling, and staff.
Spells Allowed
Druids do not have the same range of
spells as clerics. They have major access to
the following spheres: all, animal, elemen-
tal, healing, plant, and weather. They have
minor access to the divination sphere.
Druids can use all magical items normally
allowed priests, except for those that are
written (books and scrolls) and armor and
weapons not normally allowed for druids.
Granted Powers
A druid makes most saving throws as a
priest, but he gains a bonus of + 2 to all sav-
ing throws vs. fire or electrical attacks.
All druids can speak a secret language in
addition to any other tongues they know.
(lf the optional proficiency niles are used,
this language does not use a proficiency
slot.) The vocabulary of this druidic lan-
guage is limited to dealing with nature and
natural events. Druids jealously guard this
language; it is the one infallible method they
have of recognizing each another.
Additional powers are granted as the
dniid reaches higher levels:
' He can identify plants, animals, and
pure water with perfect accuracy after he
reaches 3rd level. »
' He can pass through overgrown areas
(thick thom bushes, tangled vines, briar
patches, etc.) without leaving a trail and at
his normal movement rate after he reaches
3rd level.
' He can learn the languages of woodland
creatures. These include centaurs, dryads,
elves, fauns, gnomes, dragons, giants, liz-
ard men. manticores, nixies, pixies, sprites,
and treants. The druid can add one lan-
guage at 3rd level and one more every time
he advances a level above 3rd. (lf the op-
tional proficiency rules are used, it is the
druid’s choice whether or not to spend a
proficiency slot on one or more of these lan-
guages.)

' He is immune to charm spells cast by
woodland creatures (dryads, nixies, etc.)
after he reaches 7th level.
' He gains the ability to shapechange into
a reptile, bird, or mammal up to three times
per day after he reaches 7th level. Each ani-
mal form (reptile, bird, or mammal) can be
used only once per day. The size can vary
from that of a bullfrog or small bird to as
large as a black bear. Upon assuming a new
form, the druid heals 10 to 60 percent (1d6 x
10%) of all damage he has suffered (round
fractions down). The druid can only assume
the form of a normal (real world) animal in
its normal proportions, but by doing so he
takes on all of that creature's char-
acter-istics—its movement rate and abilities,
its Armor Class, number of attacks, and
damage per attack.
Thus, a druid could change into a wren to
ﬂy across a river, transform into a black
bear on the opposite side and attack the orcs
gathered there, and finally change into a
snake to escape into the bushes before more
orcs arrive.
The druid's clothing and one item held in
each hand also become part of the new
body; these reappear when the druid
resumes his normal shape. The items cannot
be used while the druid is in animal form.
‘A druid cannot tum undead.
Ethos
As protectors of nature, druids are aloof
from the complications of the temporal
world. Their greatest concem is for the con-
tinuation of the orderly and proper cycles of
nature—birth, growth, death, and rebirth.
Druids tend to view all things as cyclic and
thus the battles of good and evil are only the
rising and falling tides of time. Only when
the cycle and balance are disrupted does the
druid become concemed. Given this view of
things, the druid must be neutral in align-
ment.
Druids are charged with protecting
wildemess—in particular trees, wild plants,
wild animals, and crops. By association,
they are also responsible for their followers
and their animals. Druids recognize that all
creatures (including humans) need food,
shelter, and protection from han'n. Hunt-
ing, famring, and cutting lumber for homes
are logical and necessary parts of the natu-
ral cycle. However, druids do not tolerate
unnecessary destruction or exploitation of
nature for profit. Druids often prefer subtle
and devious methods of revenge against
those who defile nature. lt is well known
that druids are both very unforgiving and
very patient.
Mistletoe is an important holy symbol to
druids and it is a necessary part of some
spells (those requiring a holy symbol). To be
fully effective, the mistletoe must be gath-
ered by the light of the full moon using a
golden or silver sickle specially made for the
purpose. Mistletoe gathered by other means
halves the effectiveness of a given spell, if it
causes damage or has an area of effect, and
grants the target a +2 bonus to his saving
throw if a saving throw is applicable.
Druids as a class do not dwell penna-
nently in castles, cities, or towns. All druids
prefer to live in sacred groves, where they
build small sod, log, or stone cottages.
Druid Organization
Druids have a worldwide structure. At
their upper levels (12th and above), only a
few dniids can hold each level.
Druids, Archdruids, and the Great Dnrid
At 12th level, the druid character acquires
the official title of “druid” (all druid charac-
ters below 12th level are officially known as
"initiates”). There can be only nine 12th-
level druids in any geographic region (as
defined by oceans, seas, and mountain
ranges; a continent may consist of three or
four such regions). A character cannot
reach 12th level unless he takes his place as
one of the nine druids. This is possible only
if there are currently fewer than nine dmids
in the region, or if the character defeats one
of the nine druids in magical or hand-to-
hand combat, thereby assuming the defeat-
ed dn.rid’s position. if such combat is not
mortal, the loser drops experience points so
that he has exactly 200,000 remaining—iust
enough to be 11th level.
The precise details of each combat are
worked out between the two combatants in
advance. The combat can be magical, non-
magical, or a mixture of both. lt can be
fought to the death, until only one character
is unconscious, until a predetermined num-
ber of hit points is lost, or even until the first
blow is landed, although in this case both
players would have to be supremely confi-
dent of their abilities. Whatever can be
agreed upon between the characters is legiti-
mate, so long as there is some element of
skill and risk.
When a character becomes a 12th-level
druid, he gains three underlings. Their level
depends on the character's position among
the nine druids. The druid with the most
experience points is served by three initiates
of 9th level; the second-most experienced
druid is served by three initiates of Bth level;
and so on. until the least experienced druid
is served by three 1st-level initiates.
Only three archdruids (13th level) can
operate in a geographical region. To become
an archdruid, a 12th-level druid must defeat
one of the reigning archdruids or advance
into a vacant position. Each of the three
archdruids is served by three initiates of
10th level. From among the archdruids of
the entire world, three are chosen to serve
the Grand Druid (see ‘The Grand Druid and
Hierophant Dn.rids" section). These three
retain their attendees but are themselves ser-

vants of the Grand Druid.
The great druid (14th level) is unique in
his region. He, too, won his position from
the previous great druid. He is served by
three initiates of 11th level.
The ascendance of a new great druid usu-
ally sets off shock waves of turmoil and cha-
as through the druidical hierarchy. The
advancement of ar\ archdruid creates an
opening that is ﬁercely contested by the
druids, and the advancement of a druid cre
ates an opening in their ranks.
The Grand Druid and Hlerophant Druids
The highest ranking druid in the world is
the Grand Druid (15th level). Unlike great
druids (several of whom can operate simul-
taneously in different lands), only one per-
son in a world can ever hold this title at one
time. Consequently, only one druid can be
15th level at any time.
The Grand Druid knows six spells of each
level (instead of the normal spell progres-
sion) and also can cast up to six additional
spell levels, either as a single spell or as sev-
eral spells whose levels total to six (e.g., one
oth-level spell, six 1st-level spells, three 2nd-
level spells, etc.).
The Grand Druid is attended by nine oth-
er druids who are subject only to him and
have nothing to do with the hierarchy of
any specific land or area. Any dnrid charac-
ter of any level can seek the Grand Druid
and ask to serve him. Three of these nine are
archdniids who roam the world, acting as
his messengers and agents. Each of them
receives four additional spell levels. The
remainder are nonnally dniids of 7th to
11th level, although the Grand Druid can
request a druid of any level to serve him and
often considers applications from humble
aspirants.
The position of Grand Dnrid is not won
through combat. Instead, the Grand Druid
selects his successor from the acting great
druids. The position is demanding, thank-
less. and generally unexciting for anyone
except a politician. After a few hundred
thousand experience points of such stuff,
any adventurer worthy of the name proba-
bly is ready to move on to something else.
For this reason, the Grand Druid reaches
16th level after eaming only 500,000 more
experience points. After reaching 16th level,
the Grand Druid can step down from his
position at any time, provided he can find a
suitable successor (another druid with
3,000,000 experience points).
Upon stepping down, the former Grand
Druid must relinquish the six bonus spell
levels and all of his experience points but 1
(he keeps the rest of his abilities). He is now
a 16th-level hierophant druid. and begins
advancing anew (using the progression
given in Table 23). The character may rise as
high as 20th level as a hierophant druid
(almost always through self training).



 Classes (Thief)
Beyond 15th level, a druid never gains
any new spells (ignore the Priest Spell Pro-
gression table from this point on). Casting
level continues to rise with experience.
Rather than spells, spell-like powers are
acquired.
16th level: At 16th level, the hierophant
druid gains four powers:
‘ Immunity to all natural poisons. Natu-
ral poisons are ingested or insinuated ani-
mal or vegetable poisons, including monster
poisons, but not mineral poisons or poison
gas.
° Vigorous health for a person of his age.
The hierophant is no longer subject to the
ability score adjustments for aging.
" The ability to alter his appearance at
will. Appearance alteration is accomplished
in one round. A height and weight increase
or decrease of SO percent is possible, with an
apparent age from childhood to extreme old
age. Body and facial features can resemble
any human or humanoid creature. This
alteration is not magical, so it cannot be
detected by any means short of true seeing.
17th Level: The character gains the bio-
logical ability to hibernate. His body func-
tions slow to the point where the character
may appear dead to a casual observer; aging
ceases. The character is completely uncon-
scious during hibemation. He awakens
either at a preordained time ("l will hiber-
nate for 20 days") or when there is a signifi-
cant change in his environment (the weather
tums cold, someone hits him with a stick,
etc.).
A 17th-level hierophant druid can also
enter the elemental plane of Earth at will.
The transference takes one round to com-
plete. This ability also provides the means
to survive on that plane, move around, and
retum to the Prime Material plane at will. lt
does not confer similar abilities or immuni-
ties on the Prime Material plane.
18th level: The character gains the ability
to enter and survive in the elemental plane
of Fire.
19th level: The character gains the ability
to enter and survive in the elemental plane
of Water.
20th level: The character gains the ability
to enter and survive in the elemental plane
of Air.
Rogue
Rogues are people
who feel that the world (and everyone in it)
somehow owes them a living. They get by
day by day, living in the highest style they
can afford and doing as little work as possi-
ble. The less they have to toil and struggle
like everyone else (while maintaining a com-
fortable standard of living). the better off
they think they are. While this attitude is
neither evil nor cruel, it does not foster a
good reputation. Many a rogue has a ques-
tionable past or a shady background he'd
prefer was left uninvestigated.
Rogues combine a few of the qualities of
the other character classes. They are
allowed to use a wide variety of magical
items, weapons, and armor.
Rogues have some special abilities that
are unique to their group. All rogues tend to
be adept at languages and thus have a per-
centage chance to read strange writings they
come across. All are skilled in climbing and
clinging to small cracks and outcroppings—
even more skilled than the hardy men of the
mountains. They are alert and attentive.
hearing things that others would miss.
Finally, they are dextrous (and iust a little
bit light-fingered), able to perform tricks
and filch small items with varying degrees
of success.
Rogues have a number of special abilities,
such as picking pockets and detecting noise,
for which they are given a percentage
chance of success (this chance depends on
the class, level, Dexterity score, and race of
the rogue). When a rogue tries to use a spe-
cial ability, a percentile dice roll determines
whether the attempt succeeds or fails. lf the
dice roll is equal to or less than the special
ability score, the attempt succeeds. Other-
wise, it fails. (See this page and page 39 for
more details.)
All rogues use Table 25 to determine their
advancement in levels as they gain experi-
ence points.
All rogues gain one six-sided Hit Die
(1d6) Per level from 1st through 10th. After
10th level, rogues eam 2 hit points per level
and no longer receive additional hit point
bonuses for high Constitution scores.

Ability Requirement: Dexterity 9

are the epitome of roguishness.

The thief's prime requisite is Dexterity; a
character must have a minimum score of 9
to qualify for the class. While high numbers
in other scores (particularly lntelligence) are
desirable, they are not necessary. The thief
can have any alignment except lawful good.
Many are at least partially neutral.
A thief with a Dexterity score of 16 or
more gains a 10 percent bonus to the experi-
ence points he eams.
Thieves have a limited selection of weap-
ons. Most of their time is spent practicing
thieving skills. The allowed weapons are
club, dagger, dart, hand crossbow, knife,
lasso, short bow. sling, broad sword, long
sword, short sword, and staff. A thief can
wear leather, studded leather, padded leath-
er, or elven chain armor. When wearing any
allowed armor other than leather, the thief's
abilities are penalized (see Table 29).
To determine the initial value of each
skill, start with the base scores listed on
Table 26. To these base scores, add (or sub-
tract) any appropriate modifiers for race,
Dexterity, and armor worn (given on Tables
27, 28, and 29, respectively).
The scores arrived at in the preceding par-
agraph do not reﬂect the effort a thief has
spent honing his skills. To simulate this
extra training, all thieves at 1st level receive
60 discretionary percentage points that they
can add to their base scores. No more than
30 points can be assigned to any single skill.
Other than this restriction. the player can
distribute the points however he wants.
Each time the thief rises a level in experi-
ence, the player receives another 30 points
to distribute. No more than 15 points per
level can be assigned to a single skill, and no
skill can be raised above 95 percent, includ-
ing all adjustments for Dexterity, race, and
armor. As an option, the DM can rule that
some portion of the points eamed must be
applied to skills used during the course of
the adventure.

ln addition to the base percentages listed
above, demihuman characters and charac-
ters with high or low Dexterity scores have
adjustments to their base numbers. Some
characters may find that, after adjustments,
they have negative scores. In this case, the
character must spend points raising his skill
percentage to at least 1 % before he can use
the skill. (Some races just aren't very good
at certain things!)
A thief character uses the "No Armor"
column if wearing bracers of defense or a
cloak without large or heavy protective
clothing.
Skill Explanations
Pick Pockets: The thief uses this skill
when filching small items from other peo-
ples’ pockets, sleeves, girdles, packs, etc..
when palming items (such as keys), and
when performing simple sleight of hand.
A failed attempt means the thief did not
get an item, but it does not mean that his at-
tempt was detected. To determine whether
the victim noticed the thief's indiscretion,
subtract three times the victim's level from
100. lf the thief's pick pockets roll was equal
to or greater than this number, the attempt
is detected. A Oth-level victim, for example.
notices the attempt only if the roll was 00
(100), while a 13th-level character notices
the attempt on a dice roll of 61 or more. In
some cases, the attempt may succeed and be
noticed at the same time.
Iftl'teDMwishes, hecanrulethata thief
of higher level than his victim is less
likely to be caught pilfering. The chance
that the victim notices the attempt can be
modified by subtracting the victim's level
from the thief’; level, and then adding
this number to the percentage chance the

thief is detected. For example, Ragnar. a
15th-level thief, tries to pick the pocket
of Horace, a 9th-level ﬁghter. Normally,
Ragnar would be detected if his pick
pockets roll was 73 or more (100-[3 X 9]
= 73). Using this optional system, since
Ragnar is six levels higher than Horace,
this number is increased by six to 79 (73
+ 6 1 79). This option only applies if
thethiefishigherlevel thanhisvictim.
A thief can try to pick someone's pocket
as many times as he wants. Neither failure
nor success prevents additional attempts,
but getting caught might!
Open Locks: A thief can try to pick pad-
locks, finesse combination locks (if they ex-
ist), and solve puzzle locks (locks with
sliding panels, hidden releases, and con-
cealed keyholes). Picking a padlock requires
tools. Using typical thief's tools grants nor-
mal chances for success. Using improvised
tools (a bit of wire, a thin dirk, a stick, etc.)
imposes a penalty on the character's chance
for success. The DM sets the penalty based
on the situation; penalties can range from
-S for an improvised but suitable tool. to
-60 for an awkward and unsuitable item
(like a stick). The amount of time required
to pick a lock is 1d10 rounds. A thief can try
to pick a particular lock only once per expe-
rience level. lf the attempt fails, the lock is
simply too difficult for the character until he
learns more about picking locks (goes up a
level).
Find/Remove Traps: The thief is trained
to find small traps and alarms. These in-
clude poisoned needles, spring blades,
deadly gases, and warning bells. This skill is
not effective for finding deadfall ceilings,
crushing walls, or other large, mechanical
traps.
To find the trap, the thief must be able to
touch and inspect the trapped object. Nor-
mally, the DM rolls the dice to determine
whether the thief finds a trap. If the DM
says, "You didn't find any traps," it's up to
the player to decide whether that means
there are no traps or there are traps but the
thief didn't see them. lf the thief finds a trap,
he knows its general principle but not its ex-
act nature. A thief can check an item for
traps once per experience level. Searching
for a trap takes 1d10 rounds.
Once a trap is found, the thief can try to
remove it or disarm it. This also requires
1d10 rounds. If the dice roll indicates suc-
cess, the trap is disarmed. If the dice roll
indicates failure, the trap is beyond the
thief's current skill. He can try disarming the
trap again when he advances to the next ex-
perience level. if the dice roll is 96-100, the
thief accidentally triggers the trap and suf-
fers the consequences. Sometimes (usually
because his percentages are low) a thief will
deliberately spring a trap rather than



%_llr/ Classes (Thief)
have unpleasant side effects if the trap
doesn't work quite the way the thief
thought, and he triggers it while standing in
the wrong place.
This skill is far less useful when dealing
with magical or invisible traps. Thieves can
attempt to remove these traps, but their
chances of success are half their nonnal per-
centages.
Move Silently: A thief can try to move si-
lently at any time simply by announcing
that he intends to do so. While moving si-
lently, the thief's movement rate is reduced
to 1/: normal. The DM rolls percentile dice
to deten-nine whether the thief is moving si-
lently; the thief always thinks he is being
quiet. Successful silent movement improves
the thief's chance to surprise a victim, avoid
discovery, or move into position to stab an
enemy in the back. Obviously, a thief mov-
ing silently but in plain view of his enemies
is wasting his time.
Hide in Shadows: A thief can try to disap-
pear into shadows or any other type of
concealment—bushes. curtains, crannies,
etc. A thief can hide this way only when no
one is looking at him; he remains hidden
only as long as he remains virtually motion-
less. (The thief can make small, slow, care-
ful movements; draw a weapon, uncork a
potion, etc.) A thief can never become hid-
den while a guard is watching him, no mat-
ter what his dice roll is—his position is
obvious to the guard. However, trying to
hide from a creature that is locked in battle
with another is possible, as the enemy's at-
tention is fixed elsewhere. The DM rolls the
dice and keeps the result secret, but the thief
always thinks he is hidden.
Hiding in shadows cannot be done in to-
tal darkness, since the talent lies in fooling
the eye as much as in ﬁnding real conceal-
ment (camouﬂage, as it were). However,
hidden characters are equally concealed to
those with or without infravision. Spells,
magical items, and special abilities that re-
veal invisible objects can reveal the location
of a hidden thief.
Detect Noise: A good thief pays attention
to every detail, no matter how small, in-
cluding faint sounds that most others miss.
His ability to hear tiny sounds (behind
heavy doors, down long hallways, etc.) is
much better than the ordinary person's. Lis-
tening is not automatic; the thief must stand
still and concentrate on what he's hearing
for one round. He must have silence in his
immediate surroundings and must remove
his helmet or hat. Sounds filtering through
doors or other barriers are unclear at best.
Climb Walls: Although everyone can
dimb rocky cliffs and steep slopes, the thief
is far superior to others in this ability. Not
only does he have a better climbing percent-
age than other characters, he can also climb
most surfaces without tools, ropes, or
devices. Only the thief can climb smooth
and very smooth surfaces without climbing
gear. Of course, the thief is very limited in
his actions while climbing—he is unable to
fight or effectively defend himself.
Read Languages: Out of necessity,
thieves tend to leam odd bits of informa-
tion. Among these is the ability to read vari-
ous languages, particularly as they apply to
treasure maps, deeds, secret notes, and the
like. At 4th level, the thief has enough expo-
sure to languages that he has a chance to
read most nonmagical writing. This ability
naturally improves with more experience.
However, your DM can rule that some lan-
guages (those the thief has never encoun-
tered) are indecipherable to the thief.
The die roll to read a language must be
made every time the character tries to read
a document (not just once per language). A
successful die roll means the thief puzzled
out the meaning of the writing. His under-
standing of the document is roughly equal
to his percentage chance for success: a 20
percent chance means that, if the thief un-
derstands it at all, he gets about 20 percent
of the meaning. A different document in
the same language requires another die roll
lit probably contains different words). lt
isn't necessary to keep notes about what
languages the thief has read in the past,
since each document is handled individu-
ally.
Only one die roll can be made for any
particular document at a given experience
level. lf the die roll fails, the thief can try
again after gaining a new experience level.
if the character knows how to read a
given language because he spent a proﬁ-
ciency slot on it, this dice roll is unneces-
sary for documents in that language.
Thieves have other abilities not listed on
Table 26:
Backstab: Thieves are weak in toe-to-toe
hacking matches, but they are masters of
the knife in the back. When attacking some-
one by surprise and from behind, a thief can
improve his chance to successfully hit ( +4
modifier for rear attack and negate the tar-
get'5 shield and Dexterity bonuses) and
greatly increase the amount of damage his
blow causes.
To use this ability, the thief must be be-
hind his victim and the victim must be un-
aware that the thief intends to attack him.
lf an enemy sees the thief, hears him ap-
proach from a blind side, or is wamed by
another, he is not caught unaware, and the
backstab is handled like a normal attack
(although bonuses for a rear attack still ap-
ply). Opponents in battle will often notice
a thief trying to maneuver behind them-
the first rule of fighting is to never turn
your back on an enemy! However, some-
40
one who isn't expecting to be attacked (a
friend or ally, perhaps) can be caught un-
aware even if he knows the thief is behind
him.
The multiplier given in Table 30 applies to
the amount of damage before modifiers for
Strength or weapon bonuses are added. The
weapon’s standard damage is multiplied by
the value given in Table 30. Then strength
and magical weapon bonuses are added.
Backstabbing does have limitations.
First, the damage multiplier applies only to
the first attack made by the thief, even if
multiple attacks are possible. Once a blow is
struck, the initial surprise effect is lost. Sec-
ond, the thief cannot use it on every crea-
ture. The victim must be generally
humanoid. Part of the skill comes from
knowing just where to strike. A thief could
backstab an ogre, but he wouldn't be able to
do the sarne to a beholder. The victim must
also have a definable back (which leaves out
most slimes, jellies, oozes, and the like). Fi-
nally, the thief has to be able to reach a sig-
niﬁcant target area. To backstab a giant, the
thief would have to be standing on a ledge
or window balcony. Backstabbing him in
the ankle just isn't going to be as effective.

The ogre marches down the hallway,
peering into the gloom ahead. He fails to no-
tice the shadowy form of Ragnar the thief
hidden in an alcove. Slipping into the hall-
way, Ragnar creeps up behind the monster.
As he sets himself to strike a mortal blow.
his foot scrapes across the stone. The hairy
ears of the ogre perk up. The beast whirls

stab and what remains of his day. If Ragnar
had made a successful roll to rnoue silently,
he could have attacked the ogre with it +4

times his normal damage (since he is 15th
level).
Thieves’ Cant: Thieves’ cant is a special
form of communication known by all
thieves and their associates. lt is not a dis-
tinct language; it consists of slang words
and implied meanings that can be worked
into any language. The vocabulary of
thieves’ cant limits its use to discussing
things that interest thieves: stolen loot,
easy marks, breaking and entering, mug-
ging, confidence games, and the like. It is
not a language, however. Two thieves can-
not communicate via thieves’ cant unless
they know a common language. The cant is



useful, however, for identifying fellow cads DM can choose followers appropriate to his
and bounders by slipping a few tidbits of
lingo into a normal conversation.
The concept of thieves‘ cant is historical
(the cant probably is still used today in
one form or another). although in the
ADl:D' game it has an ahistorlcally
broadbase. Afewhoursofresearchata
large library should tum up actual exam-
ples of old thieves’ cant for those who
want to learn more about the subject.
Use Scrolls: At 10th level, a thief gains a
limited ability to use magical and clerical
scrolls. A thief‘s understanding of magical
writin§ is far from complete, however. The
thief has a 7.5 percent chance to read the
scroll incorrectly and reverse the spell‘s
effect. This sort of malfunction is almost
always detrimental to the thief and his par-
ty. lt could be as simple as accidentally cast-
ing the reverse of the given spell or as
complex as a foul-up on a ﬁreball scroll,
causing the ball of ﬂame to be centered on
the thief instead of its intended target. The
exact effect is up to tl\e DM (this is the sort
:3 thing DMs enioy, so expect the unexpect-
).
Thieves do not build castles or fortresses
in the usual sense. instead, they favor small,
fortiﬁed dwellings, especially if the true pur-
pose of the building can easily be disguised.
A thief might, for example, construct a well-
protected den in a large dty behind the
facade of a seedy tavem or old warehouse.
Naturally, the true nature of the place will
be a closely guarded secret! Thieves almost
always build their strongholds in or near cit-
ies, since that is where they ply their trades
most lucratively.
This, of course, assumes that the thief is
interested in operating a band of thieves out
of his stronghold. Not all thieves have larce-
ny in their hearts, however. if a character
devoted his life to those aspects of thieving
that focus on scouting, stealth, and the intri-
cacies of locks and traps, he could build an
entirely different sort of stronghold-one
filled with the unusual and intriguing
objects he has collected during his adventur-
ous life. Like any thief‘: home, it should
blend in with its surroundings; after all, a
scout never advertises his whereabouts. It
might be a formidable maze of rooms, secret
passages, sliding panels, and mysterious
paraphernalia from across the world.
Once a thief reaches 10th level, his repu-
tation is such that he can attract followers-
either a gang of scoundrels and scalawags or
a group of scouts eager to learn from a
reputed master. The thief attracts Ado of
these fellows. They are generally loyal to
him, but a wise thief is always suspicious of
his comrades. Table 31 can be used to deter-
mine the type and level of followers. or the
campaiyt .

The bard is an optional character class
that can be used if your DM allows. He
makes his way in life by his charm, talent,
and wit. A good bard should be glib of
tongue, light of heart, and fleet of foot
(when all else fails).
Prime Requisite:
in precise historical terms, the title
"bard" applies only to oertain groups of
Celtic poets who sang the history of their
tribes in long, redtative poems. These
bards, found mainly in Ireland, Wales,
and Scotland, filled many important
roles in their eodety. They were store-

news, messengers, and even ambassa-
dors to other tribes. However, in the

Classes (Bard)
To become a bard, a character must have
a Dexterity of 12 or more, an lntelligenoe of
13 or more, and a Charisma of 15 or more.
The prime requisites are Dexterity and Cha-
risma. A bard can be lawful, neutral or cha-
otic, good or evil, but must always be
partially neutral. Only by retaining some
amount of detachment can he successfully
fulfill his role as a bard.
A bard, by his nature, tends to learn
many different skills. He is a jack-of-all
trades but master of none. Although he
ﬁghts as a rogue, he can use any weapon. He
can wear any armor up to, and including,
chain mail, but he cannot use a shield.
All bards are proficient singers, chanters,

or vocalists and can play a musical instn.\-
ment of the player's choice (preferably one
that is portable). Additional instruments
can be leamed if the optional proficiency
rules are used—the bard can learn two in-
struments for every proficiency slot spent.
In his travels, a bard also manages to
leam a few wizard spells. Like a wizard, a
bard's Intelligence determines the number of
spells he can know and the chance to know
any given spell. These he keeps in his spell
book, abiding by all the restrictions on
memorization and spell use that bind a
mage, especially in the prohibition of ar-
mor. Hence, a bard will tend to use his spells
more to entertain and impress than to fight.
Table 32 lists the number of spells a bard can
cast at each level.
Since bards are dabblers rather than full-
time wizards, their spells tend to be gained
by serendipity and happenstance. In no case
can a bard choose to specialize in a school of
magic. Beginning bards do not have a selec-
tion of spells. A Znd~level bard begins with
one to four spells, chosen either randomly
or by the DM. (An Intelligence check must
still be made to see if the bard can leam a
given spell.) The bard is not guaranteed to
know read magic, as this is not needed to
read the writings in a spell book. The bard
can add new spells to his spell book as he
finds them, but he does not automatically
gain additional spells as he advances in
level. All spells beyond those he starts with
must be found during the course of adven-
turing, The bard's casting level is equal to
his current level.

Combat and spells, however, are not the
main strength of the bard. His expertise is in
dealing and communicating with others. To
this end, the bard has a number of special
powers. The base percentage for each power
is listed on Table 33. This base percentage
must be adjusted for the race and Dexterity
of the bard as given in the Thief description.
After all adjustments are made, the player
must distribute (however he chooses) 20 ad-
ditional percentage points to the various
special abilities. Thereafter, each time the
character advances a level, he receives an
additional 15 points to distribute.

Climb Detect Pick Read
Walls Noise Pockets Languages
S0 '70 Z0 % IO % S %
Bard abilities are subject to modiﬁers for
situation and armor as per the thief (see
page 39 for a complete explanation).
Climb Walls enables the bard to climb
near sheer surfaces without the aid of tools,
just like the thief.
Detect Noise improves the bard's chances
of hearing and interpreting sounds. He may
be able to overhear parts of a conversation
on the other side of a door or pick up the
sound of something stalking the party. To
use the ability, the bard must stand un-
helmeted and concentrate for one round
(one minute). During this time, all other
party members must remain silent. The DM
secretly makes the check and infonns the
player of the result.
Pick Pockets enables the bard not only to
filch small purses, wallets, keys, and the
like, but also to perfonn small feats of
sleight-of-hand (useful for entertaining a
crowd). Complete details on pickpocketing
(and your character's chances of getting
caught) can be found in the Thief descrip-
tion.
Read Languages is an important ability,
since words are the meat and drink of bards.
They have some ability to read documents
written in languages they do not know, re-
lying on words and phrases they have
picked up in their studies and travels. The
Read Languages column in Table 33 gives
the base percentage chance to puzzle out a
foreign tongue. It also represents the degree
of comprehension the bard has if he is suc-
cessful. The DM can rule that a language is
too rare or unfamiliar, especially if it has
never been previously encountered by the
bard, effectively foiling his attempts to
translate it. At the other extreme. the bard
need not make the dice roll for any language
he is proficient in. Success is assumed to be
automatic in such cases.
The bard can also inﬂuence reactions of
groups of NPCs. When performing before a
group that is not attacking (and not intend-
ing to attack in just seconds), the bard can
try to alter the mood of the listeners. He can
try to soften their mood or make it uglier.
The method can be whatever is most suit-
able to the situation at the moment-a fiery
speech, collection of jokes, a sad tale, a fine
42
tune played on a fiddle, a haunting lute mel-
ody, or a heroic song from the old home-
land. Everyone in the group listening must
roll a saving throw vs. paralyzation (if the
crowd is large, make saving throws for
groups of people using average hit dice).
The die roll is modified by -1 for every
three experience levels of the bard (round
fractions down). If the saving throw fails,
the group's reaction can be shifted one level
(see the Reactions section in the DMG). to-
ward either the friendly or hostile end of the
scale. at the player's option. Those who
make a successful saving throw have their
reaction shifted one level toward the oppo-
site end of the scale.
Cwell the Fine has been captured by a
group of bandits and hauled into their
camp. Although they are not planning to
kill him on the spot, any fool can plainly see
that his future may be depressingly short. In
desperation. Cwell begins spinning a comic
tale about Dulce Dunderhead and his blun-
dering knights. It has always been a hit with
the peasants, and he ﬁgures its worth a try
here. Most of the bandits have 1 Hit Die, but
the few higher level lenders raise the average
level to 3. Cwell is only 2nd level so he gains
no modifier. A saving throw is rolled and
the group fails (Cwell succeedsl). The mffi-
ans ﬁnd his tale amusing. The player shifts
their reaction from hostile to neutral. The
bandits decide not to kill Cwell but to keep
him around, under guard, to entertain
them. If the bandits’ saving throw had sur-
ceeded, the bandits would have been of-
fended by the story (perhaps some of them
served under Duke Dunderheadl), and their
reaction would have shifted from hostile to
violent. They probably would have roasted
Cwell immediately.
This ability cannot affect people in the
midst of battle; it is effective only when the
audience has time to listen. if Cwell tried
telling his tale while the bandits were attack-
ing his group, the bandits would have
quickly decided that Cwell was a fool and
carried on with their business. Furthermore,
the form of entertainment used must be ap-
propriate to the audience. Cwell might be
able to calm (or enrage) a bear with music.
but he won't have much luck telling jokes to
orcs unless he speaks their language.
The music, poetry, and stories of the bard
can also be inspirational, rallying friends
and allies. If the exact nature of an impend-
ing threat is known. the bard can heroically
inspire his companions (immortalizing them
in word and song), granting a +1 bonus to
attack rolls. or a +1 bonus to saving
throws, or a +2 bonus to morale (particu-
larly useful in large battles) to those in-
volved in melee. The bard must spend at
least three full rounds singing or reciting be-
fore the battle begins. This affects those

‘ti/'
within a range of 10 feet per experience level
of the bard.
The effect lasts one round per level. Once
the effect wears off. it can't be renewed if the
recipients are still in battle. However,
troops who have withdrawn from combat
can be reinspired by the bard's words. A
troop of soldiers, inspired by Cwell. could
charge into battle. After fighting a fierce
fight. they retreat and the enemy does not
pursue. Cwell, seeing them crestfallen and
dispirited, once again rouses their will to
fight. Reinvigorated, they charge back into
battle with renewed spirit.
Bards are also able to counter the effects
of songs and poetry used as magical at-
tacks. Characters within 30 feet of the bard
are immune to the attack as long as the bard
sings a counter song (or recites a poem.
etc.). While doing this, the bard can per-
form no other action except a slow walk.
Furthermore, if he is struck or fails a saving
throw, his effort is ruined. Success is
checked by having the bard make a saving
throw vs. spell. Success blocks the attack,
failure means the attack has its nonnal ef-
fect (everyone affected rolls saving throws,
nonnal damage is inﬂicted, etc.). The bard
can use this ability once per encounter or
battle. This power does not affect verbal
spell components or command words; it is
effective against spells that involve explana-
tions, commands, or suggestions.
Finally, bards learn a little bit of every-
thing in their studies and travels. Thus all
bards can read and write their native tongue
(if a written language exists) and all know
local history (without cost if the optional
proficiency rules are used). Furthermore,
bards have a 5 percent chance per experi-
ence level to identify the general purpose
and function of any magical item. The bard
need not handle the item but must examine
it closely. Even if successful, the exact func-
tion of the item is not revealed, only its gen-
eral nature.
Since Cwell the Fine is 2nd level, he has a
10 percent chance to know something about
a magical sword +1. if he succeeds, he
knows whether the sword is cursed and
whether it has an alignment (“This sword
was used by the evil warrior Lurdas. l
wouldn't touch it if I were youl"). This ability
does not enable him to identify the sword’:
exact properties. only its history and back-
ground. He has no idea of its bonuses or pen-
alties or any special magical powers, except
as can be inferred from the histories.
Being something of a warrior, a bard can
build a stronghold and attract followers
upon reaching 9th level. The bard attracts
10d6 Oth-level soldiers into his service. They
arrive over a period of time, but they are not
automatically replaced if lost in battle. Of
course, a bard can build a stronghold any
time, but no followers arrive until he
reaches 9th level.
Classes (Multi-Class)
Upon reaching 10th level, a bard can at-
tempt to use magical devices of written
nature—scrolls, books, etc. However, his
understanding of magic is imperfect (al-
though better than that of a thief), so there is
a 15% chance that any written item he uses
is read incorrectly. When this happens, the
magical power works the opposite of what
is intended, generally to the detriment of the
bard or his friends. The DM will tell you
what happens to your character, based on
the situation and particular magical item.
The result may be unpleasant, deadly, or
embarrassing. (Deciding these things is part
of the DM's fun!)
Muiti-Class and
Dual-Class Characters
A multi-class char-
acter improves in two or more classes simul-
taneously. His experience is divided equally
between each class. The available class com-
binations vary according to race. The char-
acter can use the abilities of both classes at
any time, with only a few restrictions. Only
demihumans can be multi-class characters.
A dual-class character is one who starts
with a single class, advances to moderate
level, and then changes to a second charac-
ter class and starts over again. The charac-
ter retains the benefits and abilities of the
first class but never again earns experience
for using them. There are some limitations
on combining the abilities of the two classes
but, as long as minimum ability and align-
ment requirements are met, there are no re-
strictions on the possible character class
combinations. Only humans can be dual-
class characters.
Multl-Class Combinations
All of the standard
demihuman races are listed here, along with
their allowable multi-class combinations.
Note that the character class names (not
group names) are used below.

As stated earlier in their description, spe-
cialist wizards cannot be multi-class (gnome
illusionists are the single exception to this
rule). The required devotion to their single
field prevents specialist wizards from apply-
ing themselves to other classes. Priests of a
specific mythos might be allowed as a multi-
class option; this will depend on the nature
of the mythos as detennined by the DM.
Multi-Class Benefits and Restrictions
A multi-class char-
acter always uses the most favorable com-
bat value and the best saving throw from his
different classes.
The character's hit points are the average
of all his Hit Dice rolls. When the character
is first created, the player rolls hit points for
each class separately, totals them up, then
divides by the number of dice rolled (round
fractions down). Any Constitution bonus is
then added to the character's hit points. if
one of the character's classes is fighter and
he has a Constitution of 17 or 18, then he
gains the +3 or +4 Constitution bonus
available only to warriors (instead of the
+ Z maximum available to the other charac-
ter classes).
later the character is likely to gain levels
in different classes at different times. When
this happens, roll the appropriate Hit Die
and divide the result by the number of
classes the character has (round fractions
down, but a Hit Die never yields less than 1
hit point). The character's Constitution bo-
nus is split between his classes; thus a
fighter/ mage gets 1/: of his Con bonus when
he goes up a level as a ﬁghter and the other
‘/2 of the Con bonus when he goes up a level
as a mage. A fighter/rnage/ thief would get
‘/1 of his bonus when he goes up as a fighter,
‘ls when he goes up as a mage, and the other
‘la when he goes up as a thief.
lf the optional proficiency system is used.
the character starts with the largest number
of proficiency slots of the different dasses.

Rupert’: character, Morrison the Multi-
Fnceted, is n half-elf fighter/mug:/thief, A!
Zst level, Morrison rolls three dice for hit
points: 11110 (ﬁghter), ldo (thief), and 1d4
(mage). The results are 6, 5, and 2. Their
sum (13) is divided by three and rounded
down to equal4 (13/3 = 4 1/: = 4). Mom'-
sorr begins the game with 4 hit points. Later,
Morrison reaches 2nd level as n thief before
he reaches 2nd level as n fighter or n mage.
He rolls 1:16 for additional hit points and the
result is 4. He divides this by 3 (because he
has three classes) and rounds down. Morri-
son gets 1 more hit point when he becomes a



2nd—level thief. (He will also roll 1d10 and
1d4 [both rolls divided by 3/ when he
reaches 2nd level as a fighter and as n mage.
respectively.)
Multi-class characters can combine abili-
ties from their different classes with the fol-
lowing restrictions:
Warrlon A multi-classed warrior can use
all of his abilities without restriction. The
warrior abilities form the base for other
character classes.
Priest: Regardless of his other classes, a
multi-classed priest must abide by the
weapon restrictions of his mythos. Thus, a
fighter/cleric can use only bludgeoning
weapons (but he uses the warrior combat
value). He retains all his normal priest abili-
ties.
Wizard: A multi-classed wizard can
freely combine the powers of the wizard
with any other class allowed, although the
wearing of armor is restricted. Elves wear-
ing elven chain can cast spells in armor. as
magic is part of the nature of elves. How-
ever, elven chain is extremely rare and can
never be purchased. It must be given.
found, or won.
Thief: A multi-classed thief cannot use
any thieving abilities other than open locks
or detect noise if he is wearing armor that is
normally not allowed to thieves. He must
remove his gauntlets to open locks and his
helmet to detect noise.
Dual-Class Beneﬁts and Restrictions
Only humans can
be dual-classed characters. To be dual-
classed, the character must have scores of 15
or more in the prime requisites of his first
class and scores of 17 or more in the prime
requisites of any classes he switches to. The
character selects one class to begin his ad-
venturing life. He can advance in this class
as many levels as he desires before switching
to another class; there is no cut-off point be-
yond which a character cannot switch.
However, he must attain at least 2nd level in
his current class before changing to another
class. There is no limit to the number of
classes a character can acquire, as long as he
has the ability scores and wants to make the
change. (Certain character classes have
alignment restrictions that the character
must meet, however.)
Any time after reaching Znd level, a hu-
man character can enter a new character
class, provided he has scores of 17 or better
in the prime requisites of the new class. Af-
ter switching to a new class, the character
no longer eams experience points in his pre-
vious character class and he can no longer
advance in level in that class. Nor can he
switch back to his first class at a later date,
hoping to resume his advancement where he
left off , Once he leaves a class he has fin-
Classes (Dual-Class) 
ished his studies in it. lnstead, he starts over
in a new class, at 1st level with 0 experience
points. but he does retain his previous Hit
Dice and hit points. He gains the abilities,
and must abide by all of the restrictions, of
the new class. He does not gain or lose any
points on his ability scores (e.g., an 18
Strength mage who changes to fighter does
not gain the percentile Strength bonus, but
likewise a fighter changing to a mage would
not lose it). The character uses the combat
and saving throw tables appropriate to his
new class and level.
This is not to imply that a dual-class hu-
man forgets everything he knew before: he
still has, at his fingertips, all the knowledge,
abilities, and proficiencies of his old class.
But if he uses any of his previous class's abil-
ities during an encounter. he earns no expe-
rience for that encounter and only half
experierice for the adventure. The only val-
ues that can be carried over from the pre-
vious class without restriction are the
character's Hit Dice and hit points. The
character is penalized for using his old at-
tack or saving throw numbers, weapons or
armor that are now prohibited, and any
special abilities of the old class that are not
also abilities of the new class. (The charac-
ter is trying to leam new ways to do things;
by slipping back to his old methods, he has
set back his leaming in his new character
class.)
in addition, the character earns no addi-
tional Hit_ Dice or hit points while advanc-
ing in his new class.
The restrictions in the previous two para-
graphs last until the character reaches a
higher level in his new class than his maxi-
mum level in any of his previous classes. At
that point, both restrictions are dropped:
the character gains the abilities of his pro
vious classes without jeopardizing his
experience points for the adventure, and he
earns additional Hit Dice (those of his new
class) and hit points for gaining experience
levels in his new class.
Once these restrictions are lifted, the
character must still abide by the restrictions
of whichever class he is using at the mo-
ment. A dual-class fighter/mage, for exam-
ple, cannot cast spells while wearing armor.
Tums Blood-heart hegins his career as a
cleric with a Wisdom of 16. He rises to 3rd
level and then decides to become a fighter.
since his Strength is 17. He keeps has 14 hit
points (rolled on 3d8), but in all other ways
he is treated as a 1st-level fighter. Upon
reaching 4th level, Tums is allowed to roll
1d10 for additional hit points, He can now
cast spells as n Jrd-level cleric and fight as a
4th-level fighter, For the rest of his career,
Torus advances as n fighter but retains his
minor clerical powers-u useful advantage
when the situation gets ugly!
45
When a dual-class or multi-class charac-
ter is struck by a leveloraining creature, he
first loses levels in the class in which he has
advanced the highest. When his different
classes are equal in level, the class level re-
quiring the most experience points is lost
first.
The player character is allowed to regain
levels lost by level draining, but until he re-
gains all of his former levels, he must select
which class he will use prior to any particu-
lar adventure. Using abilities of the other
class then subjects him to the experience
penalties given earlier. When he regains all
of his former levels, he is then free to use all
the abilities of all his classes once again. Of
C0urse, he cannot raise his earlier class(esl
above the levelis) he was at when he
switched class.
Torus is o 4th-level cleric/3rd-level
ﬁghter. He is struck by a wight and loses one
level from his cleric class, since it is his high-
est level. If struck again, he would lose one
level from his fighter class. Thereafter he
could regain his last levels. but would have
to choose to act as either u ﬁghter or cleric.
Once he earned enough experience to regain
his previous ﬁghter level, he would not be
allowed to advance further in it (restoring
himself to his previous level only). But he
could still advance as o cleric and use his
3rd-level fighter abilities.

Chapter 4: Alignment
After all other steps toward creating a char-
acter have been completed, the player must
choose an alignment for the character. ln
some cases (especially the paladin), the
choice of alignment may be limited.
The character's alignment is a guide to his
basic moral and ethical attitudes toward
others, society, good, evil, and the forces of
the universe in general. Use the chosen
alignment as a guide to provide a clearer
idea of how the character will handle moral
dilemmas. Always consider alignment as a
tool, not a straitjacket that restricts the
character. Although alignment deﬁnes gen-
eral attitudes, it certainly doesn't prevent a
character from Changing his beliefs, acting
irrationally, or behaving out of character.
Alignment is divided into two sets of atti-
tudes: order and chaos, and good and evil.
By combining the different variations with-
in the two sets, nine distinct alignments are
created. These nine alignments serve well to
define the attitudes of most of the people in
the world.
Law, Neutrality,
and Chaos
Attitudes toward
order and chaos are divided into three
opposing beliefs. Picture these beliefs as the
points of a triangle, all pulling away from
each other. The three beliefs are law, chaos,
and neutrality. One of these represents each
character's ethos—his understanding of
society and relationships.
Characters who believe in law maintain
that order, organization, and society are
important, indeed vital, forces of the uni-
verse. The relationships between people and
govemments exist naturally. lawful philos-
ophers maintain that this order is not cre-
ated by man but is a natural law of the
universe. Although man does not create
orderly structures, it is his obligation to
function within them, lest the fabric of eve-
rything cnimble. For less philosophical
types, lawfulness manifests itself in the
belief that laws should be made and fol-
lowed, if only to have understandable niles
for society. People should not pursue per-
sonal vendettas, for example, but should
present their claims to the proper authori-
ties. Strength comes through unity of
action, as can be seen in guilds, empires.
and powerful churches.
Those espousing neutrality tend to take a
more balanced view of things. They hold
that for every force in the universe, there is
an opposite force somewhere. Where there
is lawfulness, there is also chaos; where
there is neutrality, there is also partisanship.
The same is true of good and evil, life and
death. What is important is that all these
forces remain in balance with each other. If
one factor becomes ascendant over its oppo-
site, the universe becomes unbalanced. lf
enough of these polarities go out of balance,
the fabric of reality could pull itself apart.
For example, if death became ascendant
over life, the universe would become a bar-
ren wasteland.
Philosophers of neutrality not only pre-
suppose the existence of opposites, but they
also theorize that the universe would vanish
should one opposite completely destroy the
other (since nothing can exist without its
opposite). Fortunately for these philoso-
phers (and all sentient life), the universe
seems to be efficient at regulating itself.
Only when a powerful, unbalancing force
appears (which almost never happens) need
the defenders of neutrality become seriously
concemed.
The believers in chaos hold that there is
no preordained order or careful balance of
forces in the universe. instead they see the
universe as a collection of things and events,
some related to each other and others com-
pletely independent. They tend to hold that
individual actions account for the differ-
ences in things and that events in one area
do not alter the fabric of the universe half-
way across the galaxy. Chaotic philoso-
phers believe in the power of the individual
over his own destiny and are fond of anar-
chistic nations. Being more pragmatic, non-
philosophers recognize the function of
society in protecting their individual rights.
Chaotics can be hard to govem as a group,
since they place their own needs and desires
above those of society.
Good, Neutrality, and Evil
Like law and order,
the second set of attitudes is also divided
into three parts. These parts describe, more
or les, a character's moral outlook: they are
his internal guideposts to what is right or
wrong.
Good characters are just that. They try to
be honest, charitable, and forthright. Peo-
ple are not perfect. however, so few are
good all the time. There are always occa-
sional failings and weaknesses. A good per-
son, however, worries about his errors and
normally tries to correct any damage done.
Remember, however, that goodness has
no absolute values. Although many things
are commonly accepted as good (helping
those in need, protecting the weak), differ-
ent cultures impose their own interpreta-
tions on what is good and what is evil.
Those with a neutral moral stance often
refrain from passing judgment on anything.
They do not classify people, things, or
events as good or evil; what is, is. ln some
cases, this is because the creature lacks the
capacity to make a moral judgment (ani-
mals fall into this category). Few normal
creatures do anything for good or evil rea-
sons. They kill because they are hungry or
46
threatened. They sleep where they find shel-
ter. They do not worry about the moral con-
sequences of their actions—their actions are
instinctive.
Evil is the antithesis of good and appears
in many ways, some overt and others quite
subtle. Only a few people of evil nature
actively seek to cause harm or destruction.
Most simply do not recognize that what
they do is destructive or disruptive. People
and things that obstruct the evil character's
plans are mere hindrances that must be
overcome. lf someone is han-ned in the pro-
cess...well, that's too bad. Remember that
evil, like good, is interpreted differently in
different societies.
Alignment Combinations
Nine different alig1-
ments result from combining these two sets.
Each alignment varies from all others,
sometimes in broad, obvious ways, and
sometimes in subtle ways. Each alignment is
described in the following paragraphs.
Lawful Good: Characters of this align-
ment believe that an orderly, strong society
with a well-organized govemment can work
to make life better for the majority of the
people. To ensure the quality of life, laws
must be created and obeyed. When people
respect the laws and try to help one another,
society as a whole prospers. Therefore, law-
ful good characters strive for those things
that will bring the greatest benefit to the
most people and cause the least harm. An
honest and hard-working serf, a kindly and
wise king, or a stem but forthright minister
of justice are all examples of lawful good
people.
Lawful Neutral: Order and organization
are of paramount importance to characters
of this alignment. They believe in a strong,
well-ordered government, whether that
government is a tyranny or benevolent
democracy. The benefits of organization
and regimentation outweigh any moral
questions raised by their actions. An inquis-
itor determined to ferret out traitors at any
cost or a soldier who never questions his
orders are good examples of lawful neutral
behavior.
Lawful Evil: These characters believe in
using society and its laws to benefit them-
selves. Structure and organization elevate
those who deserve to rule as well as provide
a clearly defined hierarchy between master
and servant. To this end, lawful evil charac-
ters support laws and societies that protect
their own concerns. lf someone is hurt or
suffers because of a law that benefits lawful
evil characters, too bad. Lawful evil charac-
ters obey laws out of fear of punishment.
Because they may be forced to honor an
unfavorable contract or oath they have
made, lawful evil characters are usually
very careful about giving their word. Once



given, they break their word only if they
can find a way to do it legally. within the
laws of the society, An iron-fisted tyrant
and a devious, greedy merchant are exam-
ples of lawful evil beings.
Neutral Good: These characters believe
that a balance of forces is important, but
that the concems of law and chaos do not
moderate the need for good. Since the uni-
verse is vast and contains many creatures
striving for different goals. a determined
pursuit of good will not upset the balance; it
may even maintain it. lf fostering good
means supporting organized society, then
that is what must be done. lf good can only
come about through the overthrow of exist-
ing social order, so be it. Social structure it-
self has no innate value to them. A baron
who violates the orders of his king to de-
stroy something he sees as evil is an example
of a neutral good character.
True Neutral: Tme neutral characters be-
lieve in the ultimate balance of forces, and
they refuse to see actions as either good or
evil. Since the majority of people in the
world make judgments, true neutral charac-
ters are extremely rare. True neutrals do
their best to avoid siding with the forces of
either good or evil, law or chaos. lt is their
duty to see that all of these forces remain in
balanced contention.
True neutral characters sometimes find
themselves forced into rather peculiar alli-
ances. To a great extent, they are compelled
to side with the underdog in any given situa-
tion, sometimes even changing sides as the
previous loser becomes the winner. A true
neutral druid might join the local barony to
put down a tribe of evil gnolls, only to drop
out or switch sides when the gnolls were
brought to the brink of destruction. He
would seek to prevent either side from be-
coming too powerful. Clearly, there are
very few true neutral characters in the
world,
Neutral Evil: Neutral evil characters are
primarily concerned with themselves and
their own advancement. They have no par-
ticular objection to working with others or,
for that matter, going it on their own. Their
only interest is in getting ahead. lf there is a
quick and easy way to gain a profit,
whether it be legal, questionable. or obvi-
ously illegal, they take advantage of it. Al-
though neutral evil characters do not have
the every-man-for-himself attitude of cha-
otic characters, they have no qualms about
betraying their friends and companions for
personal gain. They typically base their alle-
giance on power and money, which makes
them quite receptive to bribes. An unscru-
pulous mercenary, a common thief. and a
double-crossing informer who betrays peo-
ple to the authorities to protect and advance
himself are typical examples of neutral evil
characters.
Alignment (Playing Alignment)
Chaotic Good: Chaotic good characters
are strong individualists marked by a streak
of kindness and benevolence. They believe
in all the virtues of goodness and right, but
they have little use for laws and regulations.
They have no use for people who “try to
push folk around and tell them what to do."
Their actions are guided by their own moral
compass which, although good, may not al-
ways be in perfect agreement with the rest of
society. A brave frontiersman forever mov-
ing on as settlers follow in his wake is an ex-
ample of a chaotic good character.
Chaotic Neutral: Chaotic neutral charac-
ters believe that there is no order to any-
thing, including their own actions. With this
as a guiding principle, they tend to follow
whatever whim strikes them at the moment.
Good and evil are irrelevant when making a
decision. Chaotic neutral characters are ex-
tremely difficult to deal with. Such charac-
ters have been known to cheerfully and for
no apparent purpose gamble away every-
thing they have on the roll of a single die.
They are almost totally unreliable. ln fact,
the only reliable thing about them is that
they cannot be relied uponl This alignment
is perhaps the most difficult to play. Luna-
tics and madmen tend toward chaotic neu-
tral behavior.
Chaotic Evil: These characters are the
bane of all that is good and organized. Cha-
otic evil characters are motivated by the de-
sire for personal gain and pleasure. They see
absolutely nothing wrong with taking what-
ever they want by whatever means possible.
Laws and governments are the tools of
weaklings unable to fend for themselves.
The strong have the right to take what they
want. and the weak are there to be ex-
ploited. When chaotic evil characters band
together, they are not motivated by a desire
to cooperate, but rather to oppose powerful
enemies. Such a group can be held together
only by a strong leader capable of bullying
his underlings into obedience. Since leader-
ship is based on raw power, a leader is likely
to be replaced at the first sign of weakness
by anyone who can take his position away
from him by any method. Bloodthirsty buc-
caneers and monsters of low intelligence are
fine examples of chaotic evil personalities.
Non-Aligned Creatures
in addition to the
alignments above, some things—par-
ticularly unintelligent monsters (killer
plants, etc.) and animals—never bother
with moral and ethical concems. For these
creatures, alignment is simply not applica-
ble. A dog, even a well-trained one. is nei-
ther good nor evil, lawful nor chaotic. lt is
simply a dog. For these creatures, alignment
is always detected as neutral.

Playing the
Character’s Alignment
Aside from a few
minimal restrictions required for some char-
acter classes, a player is free to dioose what-
ever alignment he wants for his character.
However, before rushing off and selecting
an alignment. there are a few things to con-
sider.
First. alignment is an aid to role-playing
and should be used that way. Don't choose
an alignment that will be hard to role play
or that won't be fun. A player who chooses
an unappealing alignment probably will
wind up playing a different alignment any-
way. In that case, he might as well have cho-
sen the second alignment to begin with. A
player who thinks that lawful good charac-
ters are boring goody-two-shoes who don't
get to have any fun should play a chaotic
good character instead. On the other hand,
a player who thinks that properly role-
playing a heroic, lawful good fighter would
be an interesting challenge is encouraged to
try it. No one should be afraid to stretch his
imagination. Remember, selecting an align-
ment is a way of saying, “My character is
going to act like a person who believes this.”
Second. the game revolves around coop-
eration among everyone in the group. The
character who tries to go it alone or gets ev-
eryone angry at him is likely to have a short
career. Always consider the alignments of
other characters in the group. Certain com-
binations, particularly lawful good and any
sort of evil. are explosive. Sooner or later
the group will find itself spending more time
arguing than adventuring. Some of this is
unavoidable (and occasionally amusing),
but too much is ultimately destnictive. As
the players argue, they get angry. As they
get angry, their characters begin fighting
among themselves. As the characters fight,
the players continue to get more angry.
Once anger and hostility take over a game.
no one has fun. And what's the point of
playing a game if the players don't have
fun?
Third, some people choose to play evil
alignments. Although there is no specific
prohibition against this, there are several
reasons why it is not a good idea. First, the
AD&Df' game is a game of heroic fantasy.
What is heroic about being a villain‘! If an
evilly aligned group plays its alignment cor-
rectly. it is as much a battle for the charac-
ters to work together as it is to take on the
outside world. Neutral evil individuals
would be paranoid (with some justification)
that the others would betray them for profit
or self-aggrandizement. Chaotic evil char-
acters would try to get someone else to take
all the risks so that they could become (or
remain) strong and take over. Although
lawful evil characters might have some code



Alignment (Playing Alignment)
of conduct that govemcd their party, each
member would look for ways to twist the
rules to his own favor. A group of players
who play a harmonious party of evil char-
acters simply are not playing their align-
ments correctly. By its nature. evil
alignments call for disharmony and squab-
bling, which destroys the fun.
Imagine how groups of different align-
ments might seek to divide a treasure trove.
Suppose the adventuring party contains one
character of each alignment (a virtually
impossible situation, but useful for illustra-
tion). Each is then allowed to present his
argument:
The lawful good character says, "Before
we went on this adventure, we agreed to
split the treasure equally, and that‘: what
we're going to do. First, we'll deduct the
costs of the adventure and pay for the resur-
rection of those who have fallen, since we're
sharing all this equally. If someone can't be
raised, then his share goes to his family."
"Since we agreed to split equally, that's
fine," replies the lawful evil character
thoughtfully. "But there was nothing in this
deal about paying for anyone else's expens-
es. It's not my fault if you spent a lot on
V/*4
‘\

Q
equipment! Furthermore, this deal applies
only to the surviving partners; l don't
remember anything about dead partners.
l'm not setting aside any money to raise that
klutz. He's someone else's problem."
Flourishing a sheet of paper, the lawful
neutral character breaks in. "lt's a good
thing for you two that I've got things togeth-
er, nice and organized. I had the foresight to
write down the exact terms of our agree-
ment, and we're all going to follow them."
The neutral good character balances the
issues and decides, "l‘m in favor of equal
shares-that keeps everybody happy. I feel
that expenses are each adventurer’: own
business: lf someone spurt too much, then
he should be more careful next time. But
raising fallen comrades seems like a good
idea, so I say we set aside money to do that."
After listening to the above arguments,
the true neutral character decides not to say
anything yet. He's not particularly con-
cerned with any choioe. If the issue can be
solved without his becoming involved,
great. But if it looks like one person is going
to get everything, that’: when he'll step in
and cast his vote for a more balanced distri-
bution.

The neutral evil character died during the
adventure, so he doesn't have anything to
say. However, if he could make his opinion
known, he would gladly argue that the
group ought to pay for raising him and set
aside a share for him. The neutral evil char-
acter would also hope that the group doesn't
discover the big gem he secretly pocketed
during one of the encounters.
The chaotic good character objects to the
whole business. "book, it's obvious that the
original agreement is mmed up. I say we
scrap it and reward people for what they
did. l saw some of you hiding in the back-
ground when the rest of us were doing all
the real fighting. l don't see why anyone
should be rewarded for being a cowardl As
far as raising dead partners, I say that's a
matter of personal choice. I don't mind
chipping in for some of them, but I don't
think l want everyone back in the group."
Outraged at the totally true but tactless
accusation of cowardice, the chaotic evil
character snaps back, "book, l was doing an
important job, guarding the rearl Can l help
it if nothing tried to sneak up behind us’!
Now, it seems to me that all of you are
pretty beat up—ar\d l'm not. So. I don't
think there's going to be too much objection
if I take all the jewelry and that wand. And
I'll take anything interesting those two dead
guys have. Now, you can either work with
me and do what I say or get lost—per-
manentlyl"
The chaotic neutral diaracter is also dead
(after he tried to charge a gorgon), so he
doesn't contribute to the argument. How-
ever, if he were alive, he would join force
with whichever side appealed to him the
most at the moment. If he couldn't decide,
he'd flip a coin.
Clearly, widely diverse alignments in a
group can make even the simplest task
impossible. It is almost certain that the
group in the example would come to blows
before they could reach a decision. But
dividing cash is not the only instance in
which this group would have problems.
Consider the battle in which they gained the
treasure in the first place.
Upon penetrating the heart of the ruined
castle, the party met its foe. a powerful gor-
gon commanded by a mad warrior. There,
chained behind the two, was a helpless peas-
ant kidnapped from a nearby village.
The lawful good diameter unhesitatingly
(but not foolishly) entered the battle; it was
the right thing to do. l'le considered it his
duty to protect the villagers. Besides, he
could not abandon an innocent hostage to
such ﬁends. He was willing to fight until he
won or was dragged off by his friends. He
had no intention of fighting to his own
death, but he would not give up until he had
tried his utmost to defeat the evil creatures.
The lawful evil character also entered the
battle willingly. Although he cared nothing



for the peasant, he could not allow the two
ﬁends to mock him. Still, there was no rea-
son for him to risk all for one peasant. If
forced to retreat, he could retum with a
stronger force, capture the criminals, and
execute them publicly. If the peasant died in
the meantime, their punishment would be
that much more horrible.
The lawful neutral character was willing
to fight, because the villains threatened pub-
lic order. However, he was not willing to
risk his own life, He would have preferred
to come back later with reinforcements. lf
the peasant could be saved, that is good.
because he is part of the community. lf not,
it would be unfortunate but unavoidable.
The neutral good character did not fight
the gorgon or the warrior, but he tried to
rescue the peasant. Saving the peasant was
worthwhile, but there was no need to risk
injury and death along the way. Thus. while
the enemy was distracted in combat, he
tried to slip past and free the peasant.
The true neutral character weighed the
situation carefully. Although it looked like
the forces working for order would have the
upper hand in the battle, he knew there had
been a general trend toward chaos and
destruction in the region that must be com-
batted. He tried to help, but if the group
failed, he could work to restore the balance
of law and chaos elsewhere in the kingdom.
The neutral evil character cared nothing
about law. order, or the poor peasant. He
ﬁgured that there had to be some treasure
around somewhere. After all, the villain's
lair had once been a powerful temple. He
could poke around for cash while the others
did the real work. lf the group got into real
trouble and it looked like the villains would
attack him, then he would fight. Unfortu-
nately, a stray magical arrow killed him just
after he found a large gem.
The chaotic good character ioined the
fight for several reasons. Several people in
the group were his friends, and he wanted to
fight at their sides. Furthennore, the poor,
kidnapped peasant deserved to be rescued.
Thus. the chaotic good character fought to
aid his companions and save the peasant.
He didn't care if the villains were killed, cap-
tured, or iust driven away. Their attacks
against the village didn't concern him,
The chaotic neutral character decided to
charge. screaming bloodthirsty cries,
straight for the gorgon. Who knows? He
might have broken its nerve and thrown it
off guard. He discovered that his plan was a
bad one when the gorgon's breath killed
him.
The chaotic evil character saw no point in
risking his hide for the villagers, the peas-
ant, or the rest of the party. ln fact, he
thought of several good reasons not to. lf
the party was weakened, he might be able to
take over. lf the villains won. he could prob-
ably make a deal with them and ioin their
Alignment (Changing Alignment)
side. if everyone was killed, he could take
everything he wanted and leave. All these
sounded a lot better than getting hurt for lit-
tle or no gain. So he stayed near the back of
the battle, watching. lf anyone asked, he
could say he was watching the rear, making
sure no one came to aid the enemy.
The two preceding examples of alignment
are extreme situations. lt’s not very likely
that a player will ever play in a group of
alignments as varied as those given here. lf
such a group ever does form, players should
seriously reconsider the alignments of the
different members of the party! More often.
the adventuring party will consist of charac-
ters with relatively compatible alignments.
Even then. players who role—play their char-
acters’ alignments will discover small issues
of disagreement.
Changing Alignment
Alignment is a tool,
not a straitjacket. It is possible for a player
to change his character's alignment after the
character is created, either by action or
choice. However, changing alignment is not
without its penalties.
Most often the character's alignment will
change because his actions are more in line
with a different alignment. This can happen
if the player is not paying attention to the
character and his actions. The character
gradually assumes a different alignment.
For example, a lawful good fighter ignores
the village council's plea for help because he
wants to go fight evil elsewhere. This action
is much closer to chaotic good. since the
character is placing his desire over the need
of the community. The fighter would find
himself beginning to drift toward chaotic
good alignment.
All people have minor failings, however,
so the character does not instantly become
chaotic good. Several occasions of lax
behavior are required before the character's
alignment changes officially. During that
time, extremely lawful good activities can
swing the balance back. Although the play-
er may have a good idea of where the char-
acter's alignment lies, only the DM knows
for sure.
Likewise. the character cannot wake up
one morning and say, "I think I'll become
lawful good today.” (Well, he can say it, but
it won't have any effect.) A player can
choose to change his character's alignment,
but this change is accomplished by deeds,
not words. Tell the DM of the intention ar\d
then try to play according to the new
choice.
Finally, there are many magical effects
that can change a characters alignment.
Rare and cursed magical items can instantly
alter a character's alignment. Powerful arti-
facts may slowly erode a character's deter-
mination and willpower, causing subtle
49
shifts in behavior. Spells can compel a char-
acter to perfonn actions against his will.
Although all of these have an effect, none
are as pennaner\t or damaging as those
choices the character makes of his own free
Will.
Changing the way a character behaves
and thinks will cost him experience points
and slow his advancement. Part of a charac-
ter's experience comes from leaming how
his own behavior affects him and the world
around him. in real life, for example, a per-
son leams that he doesn't like horror movies
only by going to see a few of them. Based on
that experience, he learns to avoid certain
types of movies. Changing behavior means
discarding things the character learned pre-
viously. Relearning things takes time. This
costs the character experience.
There are other, more immediate effects
of changing alignment. Certain character
classes require specific alignments. A pala-
din who is no longer lawful good is no long-
er a paladin. A character may have magical
items usable only by specific alignments
(intelligent swords, etc.). Such items don't
function (and may even prove dangerous) in
the hands of a differently aligned character.
News of a character's change in behavior
will certainly get around to friends and
acquaintances. Although some people he
never considered friendly may now wann to
him, others may take exception to his new
attitudes. A few may even try to help him
"see the error of his ways.” The local clergy,
on whom he relies for healing, may look
askance on his recent behavior, denying him
their special services (while at the same time
sermonizing on his plight). The character
who changes alignment often finds himself
unpopular, depending on the attitudes of
the surrounding people. People do not
understand him. lf the character drifts into
chaotic neutral behavior in a highly lawful
city, the townspeople might decide that the
character is afflicted and needs close super-
vision, even confinement, for his own good!
Ultimately, the player is advised to pick
an alignment he can play comfortably, one
that fits in with those of the rest of the
group, and he should stay with that align-
ment for the course of the character's career.
There will be times when the DM, especially
if he is dever, creates situations to test the
character's resolve and ethics. But finding
the right course of action within the charac-
ter's alignment is part of the fun and chal-
lenge of role-playing.

Chapter s= Proficiencies (Optional)
Most of what a player character can do is
deﬁned by his race, class, and ability scores.
Thae three characteristics don't cover every-
thing, however. Characters can have a wide
range of talents, from the potent (and intri-
cate)arisofmagictothesimpleandmundane
knowledge of how to build a good fire. The
character's magical ability (or lack thereof) is
definedbyhisclass. Lemerabilities, suchas
ﬁre building. are deﬁned by proficiencies.
A proficiency is a learned skill that isn't
essential to the character's class. A ranger, for
example. may ﬁnd it useful to know some-
thing about navigation, especially if he lives
nearanoceanorseacoast. Ontheotherhand,
he isn't likely to stiffer if he dosrft lcnow how
to navigate; he is a ranger. not a sailor.
Profidendes are divided into two groups:
weapon proficiencis (those related to weap-
ons and combat) and nonweapon pro-
fidencies (those related to everything else).
All proficiency niles are additions to the
game. Weapon proﬁciencies are tournament-
level rules, optional in regular play, and non-
weapon proficiencies are completely optional.
Proﬁciencies are not neoasary for a balanced
game. They add an additional dimension to
characters, however, and anything that
enriches characterization is a bonus. If weap-
on profidendes are used in your game, expect
them to apply to all characters, including
NPCs. Nonweapon proficiendes may be used
by playus who enjoy them and ig1ored by
those who don't without g'ving unfair advan-
tages to anyone (provided your DM allows
this; he's the one who must deal with any
problems).
Once a proficiency slot is ﬁlled, it can
never be changed or reassigned.
Acquiring Proficlencies
Even newly cre-
ated, lst-level characters have proﬁciencies.
The number of proﬁciency slots that a char-
acter starts with is deten-nined by his group,
as shovim in Table 34. Each profidency slot
is empty until the player "fills" it by select-
ing a proﬁciency. If your DM allows non-
weapon proficiencies, the character's
Intelligence score can modify the number of
slots he has, granting him more proficien-
cies (see page 16). ln both cases. new profi-
ciencies are learned the same way.
Consider the case of Rath, a dwarf fight-
er. Table 34 gives him four weapon profi-
ciency slots (he is a warrior). lf nonweapon
proficiencies are used, he has three slots and
his lntelligence of 11 gives him two addi-
tional proficiency slots (according to Table
4, page 16) for a total of five nonweapon
proficiency slots. The player must assign
weapon or nonweapon proficiencies to all
of these slots before the character goes on
his first adventure. These represent what the
character has learned before beginning his
adventuring career.

Thereafter, as the character advances in
experience levels, he gains additional proﬁ-
ciency slots. The rate at which he gains them
depends on the group he belongs to. Table
34 lists how many weapon and nonweapon
proﬁciency slots the character starts with,
and how many levels the character must
gain before he earns another slot.
Initial Weapon Proficlencies is the num-
ber of weapon profidency slots received by
characters of that group at 1st level.
H.evel| (for both weapon and non-
weapon proficiencies) tells how quickly a
character gains additional proficiency slots.
A new proﬁciency slot is gained at every
experience level that is evenly divisible by
the number listed. Rath (a warrior), for
example, gains one weapon proficiency slot
at every level evenly divisible by 3. He gets
one new slot at 3rd level, another at 6th,
another at 9th, and so on. (Note that Rath
also gains one nonweapon proficiency at
3rd, 6th, 9th, etc.)
Penalty is the modiﬁer to the characters
attack rolls when he fights using a weapon
he is not proficient with. Rath, a dwarf,
chose to be proficient with the warhammer.
Finding himself in a desperate situation. he
snatches up a ﬂail, even though he knows
little about it (he is not proﬁcient with it).
Using the weapon awkwardly, he has a -2
penalty to his chance to hit.
Initial Nonweapon Profidencies is the
number of nonweapon proficiency slots
that character has at 1st level. Even if you
are playing with weapon proficiencies, non-
weapon proficiencies are optional.
Training
Like all skills and
abilities, proficiencies do not leap unbidden
and fully realized into a character's mind.
Instead, a character must train, study, and
practice to learn a new proficiency. How-
ever, role-playing the training time needed
to leam a new skill is not much fun. Thus
there are no training times or study periods
associated with any proficiency. When a
character chooses a proficiency, it is
assumed that he had been studying it in his
spare time.
Consider just how much spare time the
character has. The player is not role-playing
every second of his character's life. The
player may decide to have his character
spend a night in town before setting out
50
on the long joumey the next day. Perhaps
the character must wait around for several
days while his companions heal from the
last adventure. Or he might spend weeks on
an uneventful ocean voyage. What is he
doing during that time?
Among other things, he is studying what-
ever new profidencies he will eventually
leam. Using this “down time” to handle the
unexciting aspects of a role-playing cam-
paign lets players concentrate on more
important (or more interesting) matters.
Another part of training is finding a
teacher. Most skills are easier to leam if
someone teaches the character. The DM can
handle this in several ways. For those who
like simplicity, ignore the need for
teachers—there are self-taught people eve-
rywhere in the world. For those who want
more complexity, make the player charac-
ters find someone to teach them any new
proficiency they want to learn. This can be
another player character or an NPC.
Although this adds realism, it tends to limit
the PC's adventuring options, especially if
he is required to stay in regular contact with
his instructor. Furthermore, most teachers
want payment. While a barter arrangement
might be reached, the normal payment is
cash. The actual cost of the service depends
on the nature of the skill, the amount of
training desired, the availability of tutors,
the greed of the instructor, and the desire of
the DM to remove excess cash from his cam-
paign.
Weapon Proficlencles
A weapon profi-
ciency measures a character's knowledge
and training with a specific weapon. When
a character is created, the player checks
Table 34 to see how many weapon proficien-
cy slots the character has. These initial slots
must be filled immediately, before the char-
acter embarks on his first adventure. Any
slots that aren't ﬁlled by then are lost.
Each weapon proficiency slot must be
assigned to a particular weapon, not just a
class of weapons. Each weapon listed in
Table 44 (Weapons) requires its own profi-
ciency; each has its own special tricks and
quirks that must be mastered before the
weapon can be handled properly and effec-
tively. A fencer who is master of the epee,
for example, is not necessarily skilled with a
saber; the two weapons look similar, but the

fighting styls they are designed for are en-
tirely different. A player character could be-
come proficient with a long bow or a short
bow, but not with all bows in general (unless
he devotes a proficiency slot to each individ-
ually). Furthermore, a character can assign
weapon proficiency slots only to those weap-
ons allowed to his character class.
As a character reaches higher experience
levels, he also earns additional weapon pro-
ficiencies. The rate at which proficiencies
are gained depends on the character's class.
Warriors, who concentrate on their martial
skills, learn to handle a great number of
weapons. They gain weapon proficiencies
quickly. Wizards, who spend their time
studying forgotten magical arts, have little
time to practice with weapons. They gain
additional weapon proficiencies very
slowly. Multi-class characters can use the
most beneficial line on Table 34 to determine
their initial proficiencies and when they gain
new proficiencies.
Effects of Weapon Protlclencles
A character who
has a specific weapon proficiency is skilled
with that weapon and familiar with its use.
A character does not gain any bonuses for
using a weapon he is proficient with; the
combat rules and attack chances assume
that everyone uses a weapon he is proficient
with. This eliminates the need to add a mod-
ifier to every die roll during battle.
When a character uses a weapon that he is
not proficient with. however. he suffers a
penalty on his chance to hit. The size of this
penalty depends on the character's class.
Warriors have the smallest penalty because
they are assumed to have passing familiarity
with all weapons. Wizards, by comparison,
are heavily penalized because of their lim-
ited study of weapons. The modifiers for
each class (which are taken as penalties to
the attack die roll) are listed on Table 34.
Related Weapons Bonus
When a character
gainsa weapon proficiency, he is leaming to
use a particular weapon effectively. How-
ever, many weapons have similar character-
istics. A long sword, bastard sword, and
broad sword, while all different. are all
heavy. slashing swords. A character who is
trained with one can apply some of his skill
to the others. He is not fully proficient with
the weapon. but he knows more about it
than someone who picks it up without any
skill in similar weapons.
When a character uses a weapon that is
similar to a weapon he is proficient with, his
attack penalty is only one-half the nomial
amount (rounded up). A warrior. for exam-
ple, would have a <1 penalty with a related
weapon instead of -2. A wizard would
have a -3 penalty instead of -5.
Specific decisions about which weapons
are related are left to the DM. Some likely
categories are:
hand axe, battle axe;
short bow, long bow, composite bow;
heavy and light crossbows;
dagger, knife;
glaive, halberd, bardiche, voulge,
guisarme, glaive-guisanne, guisarme-
voulge;
harpoon, spear, trident, javelin:
footman's mace, horseman's mace. mom-
ing star, flail, hammer, club;
military fork, ranseur, spetum, partisan:
scimitar, bastard sword, long sword,
broad sword:
sling, staff sling
Weapon Specialization
Knowing how to
use a weapon without embarrassing your-
self is very different from being a master of
that weapon. There are warriors, and then
there are martial artists. An Olympic fencer
is more than iust an athlete; he can do things
with his weapon that astound most fencers.
In the AD&D~° game, part of your charac-
ter's skill is reflected in the bonuses he eams
as he reaches higher levels. As your charac-
ter advances. he becomes a wiser. more da.n-
gerous fighter. Experience has taught him to
anticipate his opponents and to pounce on
any advantage that presents itself. But this
is a general, overall improvement, brought
about by the Warrior's sharpening senses
and timing. lt applies equally to all types of
fighting.
Weapon specialization is an optional rule
that enables a fighter (only) to choose a sin-
gle weapon and specialize in its use. Any
weapon may be chosen. Specialization is
normally announced (and paid for with
weapon proficiency slots) when the charac-
ter is created. But even after a player charac-
ter earrts experience. he can still choose to
specialize in a weapon, provided he
51
has the weapon proficiency slots available.
In one way, a weapon specialist is like a
wizard specialist. The specialization re-
quires a single-minded dedication and train-
ing. Thus multi-class characters cannot use
weapon specialization: it is available only to
single-class ﬁghters.
Cost of Specialization
Weapon specialization is obtained by de-
voting extra weapon proficiency slots to the
chosen weapon. To specialize in any sort of
melee weapon or crossbow, the character
must devote two slots—one slot to become
proficient with it, and then a second slot to
specialize in it. Any bow (other than a cross-
bow) requires a total of three proficiency
slots: one for proficiency and two to spe-
cialize. Assume, for the moment, that Rath
the dwarf decided to specialize with the
warhammer. Two of his four proficiency
slots are thus devoted to the warhammer.
With the two remaining, he can become
proficient with the short sword and short
bow (for example).
Effects of Specialization
When a character specializes with a melee
weapon, he gains a +1 bonus to all his at-
tack rolls with that weapon and a +2 bonus
to all damage rolls (in addition to bonuses
for Strength and magic). The attack bonuses
are not magical and do not enable the char-
acter to affect a creature that can be injured
only by magical weapons.
Bow and crossbow specialists gain an ad-
ditional range category: point blank.
Point-blank range for bows is from six feet
to 30 feet. Point-blank range for crossbows
is from six feet to 60 feet. At point-blank
range, the character gains a +2 modifier on
attack rolls. No additional damage is
caused, but Strength (for bows) and magical
bonuses apply. Furthermore, if the charac-
ter has an arrow nocked and drawn, or a
bolt loaded and cocked, and has his target in
sight, he can fire at the beginning of the.
round before any initiative rolls are made.
Fighters who specialize also gain extra at-
tacks earlier than those who don't special-
ize. Bonus attacks for specialists are listed
on Table 35. The use of this table is ex-
plained in Chapter 9: Combat. Bow special-
ists do not gain any additional attacks per
round.
Nonweapon Proflclencles
A player character
is more than a collection of combat modi-
fiers. Most people have a variety of skills
leamed over the years. Consider yourself as
an example—how many skills do you pos-
sess? If you have gone through 12 years of
school, were moderately active in after-
school programs, and did fairly well on
you grades, the following might be a par-



Proflclencles (Secondary Skllls)
tial list of your skills:
English reading and writing
Geometry, algebra, and trigonometry
Basic chemistry
Basic physics
Music (playingan instrument, singing, or
both)
Spanish reading and writing (or French,
German, etc.)
Basic Shop or Home Economics
Typing
Driving
History
Basic biology
In addition to the things learned in
school, you have also learned things from
your parents, friends, scouts, or other
groups. You might be able to add any of the
following to your list.
Swimming
Hunting
Fishing
Canoeing
Sailing
Horseback riding
First aid
Animal training
Cooking
Sewing
Embroidery
Dancing
lf you consider all your hobbies and all
the things you have done, you probably
know many more skills. ln fact, if you make
a list, you probably will be surprised by the
large number of basic skills you have. And,
at this point. you are (or were) still young!
Now, having graduated from school, you
get a job. Are you just a carpenter, mechan-
ic, electrician, salesman, or secretary? Of
course not; you are a lot more than just your
job. All those things you leamed in school
and elsewhere are part of what you are.
Shouldn't it be the same for your player
character?
For a really complete role-playing charac-
ter. you should know what your character
can do. There are three different ways to do
this: using what you know, using second-
ary skills, and using nonweapon proficien-
cies. Fach of these is optional, but each
increases the amount of detail that rounds
out your character.
llslng What You Know
lf your DM decides
not to use secondary skills or nonweapon
proficiencies, situations will arise in which
you'll have to determine whether your char-
acter has certain skills. For example,
Delsenora the mage slips at the edge of a
steep riverbank and tumbles into the water.
The current sweeps her into the middle of
the river. To escape, she must swim to
safety. But does Delsenora know how to
swim?
One way to answer this is to pretend that
your character knows most of the things
that you know. Do you know how to swim?
If you do, then your character can swim. lf
you know a little about mountain climbing,
horseback riding, carpentry, or sewing,
your character knows these things, too.
This also applies to thil'\&§ Your character
might want to build. Perhaps your charac-
ter decides he wants to build a catapult. If
you can show your DM how to make such a
device, then the DM may allow your char-
acter the same knowledge. lndeed, you
might visit the local library just to gain this
information.
There are real advantages to this method.
You can learn something at the library or
school and bring it into your game. Also,
there are fewer rules to get in the way of
your fun. Since there are fewer rules, your
DM has a lot of flexibility and can play out
all the drama inherent in a scene.
There are also problems with this meth-
od. First, you probably know a lot of things
your character should not—basic electron-
ics, the components of gunpowder, or calcu-
lus. for instance. You have a lot of
knowledge that is just not available to
someone in a medieval world (even a fanta-
sy medieval world). Likewise, there are
thing that a typical person in a medieval
world would know that you, as a modem
person, have never needed to learn. Do you
know how to make armor? Skin a deer? Salt
meat away for the winter? Tum flax into lin-
en? Thatch a roof? Read heraldry? You
might, but there is no way you can consider
these common skills anymore. But in a
medieval world they would be common.
Also, knowing something about a skill or
trade doesn't mean you know a lot, and
there is a big difference between the two.
When Delsenora fell into the raging river,
she had to swim out. But was she a strong
enough swimmer to pull free of the current?
The DM must make up a nile on the spot to
handle the situation. Perhaps you can swim,
but can you swim well enough to escape a
raging torrent?
The biggest drawback to this method is
that there are no rules to resolve tricky situ-
ations. The DM must make it up during
play. Some players and DMs enjoy doing
this. They think up good answers quickly.
Many consider this to be a large part of the
fun. This method is perfect for them, and
they should use it.
Other players and DMs like to have clear
rules to prevent arguments. If this is the case
in your group, it is better to use secondary
skills or nonweapon proficiencies.
S3
Secondary Skills
The second method
for determining what your character knows
is to assign secondary skills. Secondary
skills are broad areas of expertise. Most cor-
respond to occupations that your character
may have been apprenticed in or otherwise
picked up before beginning his adventuring
life. Secondary skills are much more general
than nonweapon proficiendes. They should
not be used in combination with non-
weapon proficiencies, which are explained
later.
Every player character has a chance at a
secondary skill. Either choose one from
Table 36 or take a chance and roll randomly.
A random roll may result in one, two, or no
secondary skills.

Proflciencles (Nonweapon Proflclencles)
Once a character has a secondary skill, it
is up to the player and the DM to determine
just what the character can do with it. The
items in parentheses after each skill describe
some of the things the character knows.
Other knowledge may be added with the
DM's approval. Thus, a hunter might know
the basics of finding food in the wilderness,
how to read animal signs to identify the
types of creatures in the area, the habits of
dangerous animals, and how to stalk wild
animals.
Like the previous method ("Using What
You Know"), this method has strengths and
weaknesses. Secondary skills do not pro-
vide any rules for determining whether a
character succeeds when he uses a skill to do
something difficult. it is safe to assume that
simple jobs succeed automatically. (A
hunter could find food for himself without
any difficulty.) For more complicated tasks.
the DM must assign a chance for success. He
can assign a percentage chance, have the
character make a saving throw, or require
an Ability check (see Glossary). The DM
still has a lot of ﬂexibility.
This flexibility means the DM must some-
times make up the nile to cover the situa-
tion, however. As mentioned earlier, some
DMs enjoy this; others do not, their
strengths being elsewhere. While secondary
skills define and limit the player's options,
they do not greatly simplify the DM's iob.
Nonweapon Proﬂclencles
The most detailed
method for handling character skills is that
of nonweapon proficiencies. These are
much like weapon proficiencies. hch char-
acter starts with a speciﬁc number of non-
weapon proﬁciency slots and then eams
additional slots as he advances. lnitial slots
must be assigned immediately; they cannot
be saved or held in reserve.
Nonweapon proficiencies are the most
detailed way to handle the question of what
the player character knows. They allow the
player to choose from a broad selection and
define the effects of each choice. Like the
other methods, however, this system is not
without drawbacks. First, nonweapon pro-
ficiencies are rigid. Being so defined, they
limit the options of both the player and DM.
At the same time, there will still be ques-
tions unanswered by these proficiencies.
Whereas before such questions were broad,
they will now tend to be more precise and
detailed. Secondly, using this system
increases the amount of time needed to cre-
ate a character. While the end result is a
more complete, well-rounded person, set-
up time can take up to two or three hours.
Novice players especially may be over-
whelmed by the number of choices and
rules.
Unlike weapon proficiencies, in which
some weapons are not available to certain
character classes, all nonweapon proficien-
cies are available to all characters. Some
nonweapon proficiencies are easier for cer-
tain character classes to learn, however.
Table 37 lists all nonweapon proficien-
cies. They are divided into categories that
correspond to character groups. The profi-
ciencies listed under each group can be
leamed easily by characters of that group.
A fifth category—"General"—contains
proficiencies that can be learned easily by
any character.
Refer to Table 38. When a player selects a
nonweapon proficiency from those catego-
ries listed under "Proficiency Groups" for
his character's group, it requires the number
of proﬁciency slots listed in Table 37. When
a player selects a proﬁciency from any other
category, it requires one additional profi-
ciency slot beyond the number listed.

Using Nonweapon Froflclencles
When a character
uses a proficiency, either the attempt is auto-
matically successful or the character must
roll a proficiency check. lf the task is simple
or the proficiency has only limited game use
(such as cobbling or carpentry), a profi-
ciency check is generally not required. if the
task the character is trying to perform is dif-
ficult or subject to failure. a proficiency
check is required. Read the descriptions of
the proficiencies for details about how and
when each can be used.
55
If a proficiency check is required, Table 37
lists which ability is used with each proﬁ-
ciency. Add the modifier (either positive or
negative) listed in Table 37 to the appropri-
ate ability score. Then the player rolls 1d20.
If the roll is equal to or less than the charac-
ter's adjusted ability score, the character ac-
complished what he was t-rying to do. lf the
roll is greater than the character's ability
score, the character tails at the task. (A roll
of 20 always fails.) The DM determines
what effects, if any, accompany failure.
Of course, to use a proficiency, the char-
acter must have any tools and materials
needed to do the iob. A carpenter can do
very little without his tools, and a smith is
virtually helpless without a good forge. The
character must also have enough time to do
the job. Certainly, carpentry proficiency en~
ables your character to build a house, but
not in a single day! Some proficiency de-
scriptions state how much time is required
for certain iobs. Most, however, are left to
the DM's judgment.
The DM can raise or lower a characters
chance of success if the situation calls for
it. Factors that can affect a proficiency
check include availability and quality of
tools, quality of raw material used, time
spent doing the job, difficulty of the job,
and how familiar the character is with the
task. A positive modifier is added to the
ability score used for the check. A negative
modifier is subtracted from the ability
score.
Rath, skilled as a blacksmith, has been
making horseshoes for years. Because he is
so familiar with the task and has every tool
he needs. the DM lets him make horseshoes
automatically, without risk of failure. How-
ever. Delsenora has persuaded Rath to make
an elaborate wrought-iron cage (she needs it
to create a magical item). Rath has never
done this before and the work is very intri-
cate, so the DM imposes a penalty of -J on
Rath’s ability check.
When two proficient characters work to-
gether on the same task, the highest ability
score is used (the one with the greatest
chance of success). Furthermore, a +1 bo-
nus is added for the other character's assist-
ance. The bonus can never be more than
+ 1, as having too many assistants is some-
times worse than having none.
Nonweapon proficiencies can also be im-
proved beyond the ability score the charac-
ter starts with. For every additional
proficiency slot a character spends on a
nonweapon proficiency, he gains a +1 bo-
nus to those proficiency checks. Thus, Rath
(were he not an adventurer) might spend his
additional proficiency slots on blacksmith-
ing, to become a very good blacksmith,
gaining a + 1, +2, +3, or greater bonus to
his ability checks.
Many non-player craftsmen are more ac-
complished in their fields than player



Proficiencies (Nonweapon Proficiency Descriptions)
characters, having devoted all their energies
to improving a single proﬁciency. Likewise,
old masters normally have more talent than
young apprentices—unless the youth has an
exceptional ability scorel However, age is
no assurance of talent. Remember that
knowing a skill and being good at it are two
different things. There are bad potters.
mediocre potters, and true craftsmen. All
this has much less to do with age than with
dedication and talent.
Nonweapon Proﬁciency Descriptions
The following pro-
ficiency descriptions are arranged alphabet-
ically, not according to character class. Each
description gives a general outline of what a
character with the proficiency knows and
can do. Furthermore, some descriptions
include rules to cover spedfic uses or situa-
tions. or exact instructions on the effects of
the proficiency.
Agriculture: The character has a knowl-
edge of the basics of farming. This includes
planting, harvesting, storing crops, tending
animals, butchering, and other typical
farming chores.
Ancient History: The character has
learned the legends, lore, and history of
some ancient time and place. The knowl-
edge must be specific, iust as a historian
would specialize today in the English Mid-
dle Ages, the Italian Renaissance, or the
Roman Republic before Caesar. (The DM
either can have ancient periods in mind for
his game or can allow the players to name
and designate them.) Thus, a player charac-
ter could know details about the Age of
Thorac Dragonking or the Time of the Sea-
Raiders or whatever else was available.
The knowledge acquired gives the charac-
ter familiarity with the principal legends,
historical events, characters. locations, bat-
tles, breakthroughs (scientific, cultural, and
magical). unsolved mysteries, crafts, and
oddities of the time. The character must roll
a proﬁciency check to identify places or
things he encounters from that age. For
example, Rath knows quite a bit about the
Coming of the Trolls, a particularly dark
period of dwarven history. Moving through
some deep cavems. he and his companions
stumble across an ancient portal, sealed for
untold ages. Studying the handiwork, he
realizes (rolls a successful proficiency check)
that it bears several seals similar to those he
has seen on "banned" portals from the time
of Angnar, doorways to the legendary
realm of Trolhel.
Animal Handling: Proﬁciency in this area
enables a character to exercise a greater-
than-norrnal degree of control over pack
animals and beasts of burden. A successful
proficiency check indicates that the charac-
ter has succeeded in calming an excited or
agitated animal; in contrast, a character
without this proficiency has only a 20%
chance of succeeding in the attempt.
Animal Lore: This proficiency enables a
character to observe the actions or habitat
of an animal and interpret what is going on.
Actions can show how dangerous the crea-
ture is, whether it is hungry. protecting its
young, or defending a nearby den. Further-
more, careful observation of signs and
behaviors can even indicate the location of a
water hole, animal herd, predator, or
impending danger, such as a forest fire. The
DM will secretly roll a proficiency check. A
successful check means the character under-
stood the basic actions of the creature. lf the
check fails by 4 or las, no information is
gained. If the check fails by S or more, the
character misintcrprets the actions of the
animal.
A character may also imitate the calls and
cries of animals that he is reasonably familiar
with, based on his background. This ability
is limited by volume. The roar of a tyranno-
saurus rot would be beyond the abilities of a
normal character. A successful proficiency
check means that only magical means can
 the character's call from that of
the true animal. The my is sufficient to fool
animals, perhaps frightening them away or
luring them closer. A failed check means the
sound is incorrect in some slight way. A
failed call may still fool some listeners, but
creature very familiar with the cry automat-
ically detect a false call. All other creatures
and characters are allowed a Wisdom check
to detect the fake.
Finally, animal lore increases the chance
of succesfully setting snares and traps (for
hunting) since the character knows the gen-
eral habits of the creature hunted.
Animal Training: Characters with this
profidency can train one type of creature
(declared when the proﬁciency is chosen) to
obey simple commands and perform tricks.
A character can spend additional proficien-
cies to train other types of creatures or can
improve his skill with an already chosen
type. Creatures typically trained are do§,
horses, falcons, pigeons, elephants, ferrets,
and parrots. A character can choose even
more exotic creatures and monsters with
animal intelligence (although these are diffi-
cult to control).
A trainer can work with up to three cea-
tures at one time. The trainer may choose to
teach general tasks or specific tricks. A gen-
eral task gives the creature the ability to
react to a number of nonspecific commands
to do its job. Examples of tasks include



Protlclencles (Nonweapon Proficiency Descriptions)
.|__
-i
guard and attack, carry a rider, perform
heavy labor, hunt, track, or fight alongside
soldiers (such as a war horse or elephant). A
specific trick teaches the trained creature to
do one specific action. A horse may rear on
command, a falcon may pluck a designated
obiect, a dog may attack a specific person,
or a rat may run through a particular maze.
With enough time, a creature can be trained
to do both general tasks and specific tricks.
Training for a general task requires three
months of uninterrupted work. Training for
a spedfic trick requires zde weeks. At the
end of the training time, a proficiency check
is made. If successful, the animal is trained.
lf the die roll fails, the beast is untrainable.
An animal can be trained in 2d4 general
tasks or speciﬁc tricks, or any combination
of the two.
An animal trainer can also try to tame
wild animals (preparing them for training
later on). Wild animals can be tamed only
when they are very young. The taming
requires one month of unintemipted work
with the creature. At the end of the month, a
proﬁciency check is made. lf successful, the
beast is suitable for training. If the check
fails, the creature retains enough of its wild
behavior to make it untrainable. lt can be
kept, though it must be leashed or caged.

Appraising: This proficiency is highly
useful for thieves, as it allows characters to
estimate the value and authenticity of
antiques, art objects, jewelry, cut gem-
stones, or other crafted items they find
(although the DM can exclude those items
too exotic or rare to be well known). The
character must have the item in hand to
examine. A successful proficiency check
(rolled by the DM) enables the character to
estimate the value of the item to the nearest
100 or 1,000 gp and to identify fakes. On a
failed check, the character cannot estimate a
price at all. On a roll of 20, the character
wildly misreads the value of the item.
always to the detriment of the character.
Arrnoren This character can make all of
the types of armor listed in the Players
Handbook, given the proper materials and
facilities. When making armor, the profi-
ciency check is rolled at the end of the nor-
mal construction time.
The time required to make armor is equal
to two weeks per level of AC below 10. For
example, a shield would require two weeks
of work, whereas a suit of full plate armor
would require 1B weeks of work.
lf the proficiency check indicates failure
but is within 4 of the amount needed for suc-
cess, the arrnorer has created usable, but
flawed, armor. Such armor functions as 1
AC worse than usual, although it looks like
the armor it was intended to be. Only a
character with arrnorer proficiency can
detect the flaws, and this requires careful
and detailed inspection.
lf the flawed armor is struck in melee
combat with a natural die roll of 19 or 20, it
breaks. The character's AC immediately
worsens by 4 additional classes (although
never above 10), and the broken armor
hampers the character's movement. Until
the character can remove the broken armor
la process requiring 1d4 rounds), the char-
acter moves at 1/z of his normal rate and suf-
fers a -4 penalty to all of his attack rolls.
if an annorer is creating a suit of field
plate or full plate armor, the character who
will use the armor must be present at least
once a week during the creation of the
armor, since such types of armor require
very exact fitting.
Artistic Ability: Player characters with
artistic ability are naturally accomplished in
various forms of the arts. They have an
inherent understanding of color, form.
space, flow, tone, pitch, and rhythm. Char-
acters with artistic ability must select one
art form (painting, sculpture, composition,
etc.) to be proficient in. Thereafter they can
attempt to create art works or musical com-
positions in their given field. Although it is
not necessary to make a proﬁciency check.
one can be made to determine the quality of
the work. lf a 1 is rolled on the check, the
artist has created a work with some truly
lasting value. if the check fails, the artist has
created something aesthetically unpleasing
or just plain bad.
Artistic ability also Confers a + 1 bonus to
all proficiency checks requiring artistic
skill-—~music or dance—and to attempts to
appraise objects of art.
Astrology: This proficiency gives the
character some understanding of the sup-
posed inﬂuences of the stars. Knowing the
birth date and time of any person, the
astrologer can study the stars and celestial
events and then prepare a forecast of the
future for that person. The astrologers
insight into the future is limited to the next
30 days, and his knowledge is vague at best.
lf a successful proficiency check is made, the
astrologer can foresee some genera] event-
51
a great battle, a friend lost, a new friendship
made, etc. The DM decides the exact predic-
tion (based on his intentions for the next few
gaming sessions). Note that the prediction
does not guarantee the result—it only indi-
cates the potential result. lf the proficiency
check is failed, no information is gained
unless a 20 is rolled, in which case the pre-
diction is wildly inaccurate.
Clearly this proficiency requires prepara-
tion and advance knowledge on the part of
the DM. Because of this, it is permissible for
the DM to avoid the question, although this
shouldn't be done all the time. Players who
want to make their DM's life easier (always
a good idea) should consider using this pro-
ficiency at the end of a gaming session, giv-
ing the DM until the next session to come up
with an answer. The DM can use this profi-
ciency as a catalyst and guide for his
adv:ntures—something that will prompt
the player characters to go to certain places
or to try new things.
Characters with the astrology proficiency
gain a + 1 bonus to all navigation proficien-
cy checks, provided the stars can be seen.
Blacksmithlng: A character with black-
smithing profidency is capable of making
tools and implements from iron. Use of the
proficiency requires a forge with a coal-fed
fire and bellows, as well as a hammer and
anvil. The character cannot make armor or
most weapons, but can craft crowbars,
grappling hooks. horseshoes, nails, hinges,
plows, and most other iron objects.
Blind-fighting: A character with blind-
ﬁghting is skilled at fighting in conditions of
poor or no light (but this proﬁciency does
not allow spell use). In total darkness, the
character suffers only a -Z penalty to his
attack roll (as compared to a -4 penalty
without this proficiency). Under starlight or
moonlight, the character incurs only a -1
penalty. The character suffers no penalties
to his AC because of darkness.
Furthermore, the character retains special
abilities that would normally be lost in
darkness, although the effectiveness of these
are reduced by one-half (proficiency checks
are made at half the normal score, etc.).
This proficiency is effective only against
opponents or threats within melee distance
of the character. Blind-fighting does not
grant any special protection from missile
fire or anything outside the immediate range
of the character's melee weapon. Thus AC
penalties remain for missile fire. (By the
time the character hears the whoosh of the
arrow, for example, it is too late for him to
react.)
While moving in darkness. the character
suffers only half the normal movement pen-
alty of those without this proficiency.
Furthermore, this skill aids the character
when dealing with invisible creatures,
reducing the attack penalty to -2. How-
ever, it does not enable the character to dis-



Proflciencles (Nonweapon Proficiency Descriptions)
cover invisible creatures; he has only a gen-
eral idea of their location and cannot target
them exactly.
Bowyer/Fletcher: This character can
make bows and arrows of the types given in
Table 44, page 68.
A weaponsmith is required to fashion
arrowheads, but the bowyer/fletcher can
perform all other necessary functions. The
construction time for a long or short bow is
one week, while composite bows require
two weeks, and 1d6 arrows can be made in
one day.
When the construction time for the weap-
on is completed, the player makes a profi-
ciency check. lf the check is successful, the
weapon is of fine quality and will last for
many years of nonnal use without break-
ing. if the check fails. the weapon is still usa-
ble, but has a limited life span: An arrow
breaks on the first shot; a bow breaks if the
character using it rolls an unmodified 1 on
his 1dZ0 attack roll.
Option: if a character wishes to create a
weapon of truly fine quality and the DM
allows it, the player can opt to use the fol-
lowing altemative procedure for detennin-
ing the success of his attempt. When the
proficiency check is made, any failure
means that the weapon is useless. However,
a successful check means that the weapon
enables the character to add Strength
bonuses to attack and damage rolls. Addi-
tionally, if the proficiency check is a natural
1, the range of the bow is increased 10 yards
for all range classes or is of such fine work
that it is suitable for enchantment.
Brewing: The character is trained in the
art of brewing beers and other strong drink.
The character can prepare brewing formu-
las, select quality ingredients, set up and
manage a brewery, control fermentation,
and age the finished product.
Carpentry: The carpentry proficiency
enables the character to do woodworking
jobs: building houses, cabinetry, joinery.
etc. Tools and materials must be available.
The character can build basic items from
experience, without the need for plans.
Unusual and more complicated items (a cat-
apult, for example) require plans prepared
by an engineer. Truly unusual or highly
complex items (wooden clockwork mecha-
nisms, for example) require a proficiency
check.
  _ _.._
 ﬁg
k
Charioteering: A character with profi-
ciency in this skill is able to safely guide a
chariot, over any type of terrain that can
normally be negotiated, at a rate 1/: faster
than the normal movement rate for a char-
iot driven by a character without this profi-
ciency. Note that this proficiency does not
impart the ability to move a chariot over
terrain that it cannot traverse; even the best
charioteer in the world cannot take such a
vehicle into the mountains.
Cobbiing: The character can fashion and
repair shoes, boots, and sandals.
Cooking: Although all characters have
mdimentary cooking skills. the character
with this proficiency is an accomplished
cook. A proficiency check is required only
when attempting to prepare a truly magnifi-
cent meal worthy of a master chef.
Dancing: The character knows many
styles and varieties of dance, from folk
dances to formal court balls.
Direction Sense: A character with this
proficiency has an innate sense of direction.
By concentrating for ido rounds, the char-
acter can try to determine the direction the
party is headed. lf the check fails but is less
than 20. the character errs by 90 degrees. If a
20 is rolled, the direction chosen is exactly
opposite the tnie heading. (The DM rolls
the check.)
Furthermore, when traveling in the wil-
demess, a character with direction sense has
the chance of becoming lost reduced by 5%.
Disguise: The character with this skill is
trained in the art of disguise. He can make
himself look like any general type of person
of about the same height, age, weight, and
race. A successful proficiency check indi-
cates that the disguise is successful, while a
failed roll means the attempt was too obvi-
ous in some way.
The character can also disguise himself as
a member of another race or sex. In this
case, a -7 penalty is applied to the proﬁ-
ciency check. The character may also
attempt to disguise himself as a specific per-
son, with a -10 penalty to the proficiency
check. These modiﬁers are cumulative, thus
it is extremely difficult for a character to dis-
guise himself as a specific person of another
race or sex (a ~17 penalty to the check).
Endurance: A character with endurance
proficiency is able to perform continual
strenuous physical activity for twice as long
as a nonnal character before becoming sub-
iect to the effects of fatigue and exhaustion.
in those cases where extreme endurance is
required, a successful proficiency check
must be made. Note that this proficiency
does not enable a character to extend the
length of time that he can remain unaffected
by a lack of food or water.
Engineering: The character is trained as a
builder of both great and small things. Engi-
neers can prepare plans for everything from
simple machines (catapults, river locks,
58
grist mills) to large buildings (fortresses,
dams). A proﬁciency check is required only
when designing something particularly
complicated or unusual. An engineer must
still find talented workmen to carry out his
plan, but he is trained to supervise and man-
age their work.
An engineer is also familiar with the prin-
ciples of siegecraft and can detect flaws in
the defenses of a castle or similar construc-
tion. He knows how to construct and use
siege weapor\s and machines, such as cata-
pults, rams. and screws.
Etiquette: This proficiency gives the char-
acter a basic understanding of the proper
fomis of behavior and address required in
many different situations, especially those
involving nobility and persons of rank.
Thus, the character will know the correct
title to use when addressing a duke, the
proper steps of ceremony to greet visiting
diplomats, gestures to avoid in the presence
of dwarves, etc. For extremely unusual
occurrences, a proficiency check must be
made for the character to know the proper
etiquette for the situation (an imperial visit,
for example, is a sufficiently rare event).
However, having the character know
what is correct and actually do what is cor-
rect are two different matters. The encoun-
ters must still be role-played by the
character. Knowledge of etiquette does not
give the character protection from a gaffe or
faux pas; many people who know the cor-
rect thing still manage to do the exact oppo-
site.
Hre-buiiding: A character with fire-
building proficiency does not normally need
a tinderbox to start a fire. Given some dry
wood and small pieces of tinder, he can start
a fire in 2d20 minutes. Flint and steel are not
required. Wet wood, high winds, or other
adverse conditions increase the time to
3d20, and a successful proficiency check
must be rolled to start a fire.
Fishing: The character is skilled in the art
of fishing. be it with hook and line, net, or
spear. Each hour the character spends fish-
ing, roll a proficiency check. if the roll is
failed, no fish are caught that hour. Other-
wise, a hook and line or a spear will land
fish equal to the difference between the die
roll and the character's Wisdom score. A net
will catch three times this amount.
Of course, no fish can be caught where no
fish are found. On the other hand, some
areas teem with fish, such as a river or pool
during spawning season. The DM may
modify the results according to the situa-
tion.
Forgery: This proficiency enables the
character to create duplicates of documents
and handwriting and to detect such forger-
ies created by others. To forge a document
(military orders, local decrees, etc.) where
the handwriting is not specific to a person,
the character needs only to have seen a simi-



Proticiencies (Nonweapon Proﬁciency Descriptions)
'iT
lar document before. To forge a name, an
autograph of that person is needed, and a
proficiency check with a -2 penalty must
be successfully rolled. To forge a longer doc-
ument written in the hand of some particu-
lar person, a large sample of his
handwriting is needed, with a -3 penalty to
the check.
lt is important to note that the forger
always thinks he has been successful; the
DM rolls the character's proficiency check
in secret and the forger does not leam of a
failure until it is too late.
if the check succeeds, the work will pass
examination by all except those intimately
familiar with that handwriting or by those
with the forgery proficiency who examine
the document carefully. If the check is
failed, the forgery is detectable to anyone
familiar with the type of document or
handwriting—if he examines the document
closely. If the die roll is a 20, the forgery is
immediately detectable to anyone who nor-
mally handles such documents without
close examination. The forger will not real-
ize this until too late.
Furthermore, those with forgery profi-
ciency may examine a document to learn if
it is a forgery. On a successful proficiency
roll, the authenticity of any document can
be ascertained. if the die roll is failed but a
20 is not rolled, the answer is unknoum. if a
Z0 is rolled, the character reaches the incor-
rect conclusion.
Gaining: The character knows most com-
mon games of chance and skill, including
cards, dice. bones, draughts, and chess.
When playing a game. the character may
either play out the actual game (which may
take too much time for some) or make a pro-
ficiency check, with success indicating vic-
tory. lf two proficient characters play each
other, the one with the highest successful die
roll wins. A character with gaming profi-
ciency can also attempt to cheat, thus gain-
ing a +1 bonus to his ability score. lf the
proficiency check for the game is 17 to 20,
however, the character has been caught
cheating (even if he won the game).
Gent Cutting: A character with this profi-
ciency can finish the rough gems that are
discovered through mining at a rate of 1d1O
stones per day. A gem cutter derives no ben-
efit from the assistance of nonproficient
characters. A gem cutter must work with a
good light source and must have an assort-
ment of chisels, small hammers, and special-
ly hardened blades.
Uncut gems, while still of value, are not
nearly as valuable as the finished product. if
the cutting is successful (as detemiined by a
proficiency check), the gem cutter increases
the value of a given stone to the range
appropriate for its type. If a 1 is rolled, the
work is exceptionally brilliant and the value
of the gem falls into the range for the next
most valuable gem (the DM has the relevant
tables).
Healing: A character proficient in healing
knows how to use natural medicines and
basic principles of first aid and doctor-ing. If
the character tends another within one
round of wounding (and makes a successful
proficiency check), his ministrations restore
1d3 hit points (but no more hit points can be
restored than were lost in the previous
round). Only one healing attempt can be
made on a character per clay.
If a wounded character remains under the
care of someone with healing proﬁciency.
that character can recover lost hit points at
the rate of 1 per day even when traveling or
engaging in nonstrenuous activity. If the
wounded character gets complete rest, he
can recover 2 hit points per day while under
such care. Only characters with both heal-
ing and herbalism proficiencies can help
others recover at the rate of 3 hit points per
day of rest. This care does not require a pro-
ficiency check, only the regular attention of
the proficient character. Up to six patients
can be cared for at any time.
A character with healing proficiency can
also attempt to aid a poisoned individual,
provided the poison entered through a
wound. lf the poisoned character can be
tended to immediately (the round after the
character is poisoned) and the care con-
tinues for the next five rounds, the victim
gains a +2 bonus to his saving throw (delay
his saving throw until the last round of tend-
ing). No proﬁciency check is required, but
the poisoned character must be tended to
immediately (normally by sacriﬁcing any
other action by the proficient character) and
cannot do anything himself. lf the care and
rest are interrupted, the poisoned character
must immediately roll a normal saving
throw for the poison. This result is unalter-
able by normal means (i.e., more healing
doesn't help). Only characters with both
healing and herbalism proficiencies can
attempt the same treatment for poisons the
victim has swallowed or touched (the char-
acter uses his healing to diagnose the poison
and his herbalist knowledge to prepare a
purgative).
A character with healing proficiency can
also attempt to diagnose and treat diseases.
When dealing with normal diseases, a suc-
cessful proficiency check automatically
reduces the disease to its mildest form and
shortest duration. Those who also have her-
balism knowledge gain an additional +2
bonus to this check. A proficient character
can also attempt to deal with magical dis-
eases, whether caused by spells or creatures.
ln this case, a successful proﬁciency check
diagnoses the cause of the disease. How-
ever, since the disease is magical in nature, it
can be treated only by magical means.
Heraldry: The knowledge of heraldry
enables the character to identify the differ-
ent crests and symbols that denote different
59
persons and groups. Heraldry comes in
many forms and is used for many different
purposes. it can be used to identify noble-
men, families, guilds, sects, legions, politi-
cal factions, and castes. The symbols may
appear on flags, shields, helmets, badges,
embroidery, standards, clothing, coins, and
more. The symbols used may include geo-
metric patterns, calligraphed lines of script,
fantastic beasts, religious symbols, and
magical seals (made for the express purpose
of identification). Heraldry can vary from
the highly formalized rules and regulations
of late medieval Europe to the knowledge of
different shield pattems and shapes used by
African tribesmen.
The character automatically knows the
different heraldic symbols of his homeland
and whom they are associated with. In addi-
tion, if the character makes a successful pro-
ﬁciency check, he can correctly identify the
signs and symbols of other lands, provided
he has at least a passing knowledge of the
inhabitants of that land. His heraldry skill is
of little use upon first entering a foreign
land.
Herbalism: Those with herbalist knowl-
edge can identify plants and fungus and pre-
pare nonmagical potions, poultices,
powders, balms. salves, ointments, infu-
sions, and plasters for medical and pseudo-
medical purposes. They can also prepare
natural plant poisons and purgatives. The
DM must decide the exact strength of such
poisons based on the poison rules in the
DMC. A character with both herbalism and
healing proficiencics gains bonuses when
using his healing talent (see the Healing pro-
ficienfy).
Hunting: When in wilderness settings, the
character can attempt to stalk and bring
down game. A proficiency check must be
made with a -1 penalty to the ability score
for every nonproﬁcient hunter in the party.
if the die roll is successful, the hunter (and
those with him) have come within 101 to
200 yards (100 + 1d100) of an animal. The
group can attempt to close the range, but a
proficiency check must be made for each 20
yards closed. if the stalking is successful, the
hunter automatically surprises the game.
The type of animal stalked depends on the
nature of the terrain and the whim of the
DM.
juggling: The character can juggle, a tal-
ent useful for entertainments, diversions,
and certain rare emergencies. When jug-
gling normally (to entertain or distract), no
proﬁciency check is required. A check is
made when trying spectacular tricks
(‘Watch me eat this apple in mid-airl").
However, juggling also enables the charac-
ter to attempt desperate moves. On a suc-
cessful attack roll vs. AC 0 (not a
proﬁciency check), the character can catch
small items thrown to harm him (as
opposed to items thrown for him to catch).

Proficiencies (Nonweapon Proficiency Descriptions)
Thus the character could catch a dagger or a
dart before it hits. lf this attack roll fails.
however, the character automatically suf-
fers damage (sticking your hand in the path
of a dagger is likely to hurt).
jumping: The character can attempt
exceptional leaps both vertically and hor-
izontally. lf the character has at least a 20-
foot running start, he can leap (broad jump)
2d6 + his level in feet. No character can
broad jump more than six times his height,
however. With the same start. he can leap
vertically (high jump) 1d3 plus half his level
in feet. No character can high jump more
than 1‘/z times his own height.
From a standing start, a character with
this proficiency can broad jump 1d6 plus
half his level in feet and high jump only
three feet.
The character can also attempt vaults
using a pole. A vault requires at least a 30-
foot running start. If a pole is used, it must
be four to 10 feet longer than the character's
height. The vault spans a distance equal to
1‘/z tirns the length of the pole. The charac-
ter can clear heights equal to the height of
the pole. He can also choose to land on his
feet if the vault carries him over an obstacle
no higher than ‘/2 the height of his pole.
Thus, using a 12-foot pole, the character
could either vault through a window 12 feet
off the ground (tumbling into the room
beyond), land on his feet in an opening six
feet off the ground, or vault across a moat
18 feet wide. ln all cases. the pole is dropped
at the end of the vault.
Languages, Ancient: The character has
mastered a difficult and obscure tongue,
now primarily found in the writings of
pedantic sages and sorcerers. The main use
of the language is to read tomes of ancient
secrets written by long-dead mystics. This
proficiency enables the character to either
read and write or speak the language (his
choice).
Languages, Modern: The character has
learned to speak a language of the known
world. To do so, there must be a teacher
available. This could be another player
character, an NPC hireling. or simply a
local townsman.
Leatherworicing: This proﬁciency enables
a character to tan and treat leather and to
make clothing and other leather objects.
The character can make leather armor, as
well as backpacks, saddlebags, saddles, and
all sorts of hamesses.
Local History: The character is a store-
house of facts about the history of a region
the size of a large county or a small prov-
inoe. The character knows when the ruined
tower on the hill was built and who built it
(and what happened to him), what great
heroes and villains fought and fell at the old
battlefield, what great treasure is supposed
to be kept in a local temple, how the mayor
of the next town miraculously grew hair on
his balding pate, and more.
The DM will provide information about
local sites and events as the character needs
to know them. Furthermore, the character
can try to retell these events as entertaining
stories. Once the subject is chosen, he can
either make a profidency check and, if suc-
cessful, add that tale to his repertoire, or
actually tell the story to other characters. lf
the character succeeds in entertaining them,
the player need not make a proficiency roll
for the character, since he has succeeded.
The character can tell these stories to enter-
tain others, granting him a +2 bonus to his
Charisma for the encounter. But telling sto-
ries to hostile beings is probably not going
to do any good.
Mining: A character with mining profi-
ciency is needed to site and supervise the
operations of any mine. First, the character
can attempt to determine what types of ores
or gems can be found in a given area. To do
this, he must spend at least a week searching
a four-square-mile area. The DM may rule
that more area must be searched to find any-
thing of value and may thus increase the
amount of time required. At the end of the
search, the character can say what is likely
to be found in this area. After this. the char-
acter can site the mine. On a successful pro-
ficiency check (made secretly by the DM).
the character has found a good site to begin
mining for any minerals that may be in the
area. The check does not guarantee a suc-
cessful mine, only that a particular site is the
best choice in a given area. The DM must
determine what minerals. if any, are to be
found in the region of the mine. On a failed
check. the character only thinks he has
found a good site. Much effort is spent
before the character is proved wrong, of
course.
Once the mine is in operation, a character
with mining proficiency must remain on-
site to supervise all work. Although this is a
steady job, most player characters will find
it better to hire an NFC for this purpose.
Mountaineering: A character with this
proficiency can make difficult and danger-
ous climbs up steep slopes and cliffs with the
aid of spikes, ropes, etc. lf a character with
mountaineering proficiency leads a party,
placing the pitons (spikes) and guiding the
others, all in the party can gain the benefit
of his knowledge. A mountaineer can guide
a party up a cliff face it could not otherwise
climb. A character with this profidency
gains a 10 percent bonus per proficiency slot
spent to his chance to climb any surface.
Note that mountaineering is not the same as
the thief's climbing ability, since the latter
does not require aids of any sort.
Musical lnstruinent: The character can
play a specific musical instnirnent. An addi-
tional instrument can be added for every
extra slot devoted to this proﬁciency. The
character plays quite well, and no proficien-
6|
cy check is normally required. The DM may
direct the character to make a proficiency
check in what he feels are extraordinary cir-
curnstances.
Navigation: The character has leamed the
arts of navigating by the stars. studying cur-
rents, and watching for telltale signs of
land, reefs, and hidden danger. This is not
particularly useful on land. At sea, a suc-
cessful proficiency check by the navigator
reduces the chance of getting lost by Z0 per-
cent.
Pottery: A character with this proficiency
can create any type of clay vessel or con-
tainer commonly used in the campaign
world. The character requires a wheel and a
kiln, as well as a supply of clay and glaze.
The character can generally create two
small- or medium-sized items or one large-
sized item per day. The pieces of pottery
must then be fired in the kiln for an addi-
tional day.
The raw materials involved cost three cp
to make a small item, five cp to make a
medium-sized item, and one sp to make a
large item.
Reading Lips: The character can under-
stand the speech of those he can see but not
hear. When this proficiency is chosen, the
player must specify what language the char-
acter can lip read (it must be a language the
character can already speak). To use the
proficiency, the character must be within 30
feet of the speaker and be able to see him
speak. A proficiency check is made. if the
check fails, nothing is leamed. If the check is
successful, 70 percent of the conversation is
understood. Since certain sounds are impos-
sible to differentiate, the understanding of a
lip-read conversation is never better than
this.
Reading/Writing: The character can read
and write a modern language he can speak,
provided there is someone available to teach
the character (another PC, a hireling, or an
NPC). This proficiency does not enable the
character to leam ancient languages (see
Languages, Ancient).
Religion: Characters with religion profi-
ciency know the common beliefs and cults
of their homeland and the major faiths of
neighboring regions. Ordinary information
(type of religious symbol used, basic atti-
tude of the faith, etc.) of any religion is
automatically known by the character. Spe-
cial information. such as how the clergy is
organized or the significance of particular
holy days, requires a proficiency check.
Additional proficiencies spent on religion
enable the character either to expand his
general knowledge into more distant
regions (using the guidelines above) or to
gain precise information about a single
faith. lf the latter is chosen, the character is
no longer required to make a proficiency
check when answering questions about that
religion. Such expert knowledge is highly



Proﬂclencies (Nonweapon Proficiency Descriptions)
useful to priest characters when dealing
with their own and rival faiths.
Riding. Airborne: The character is trained
in handling a ﬂying mount. The particular
creature must be chosen when the proficien-
cy is chosen. Additional proficiency slots can
be used to leam how to handle other types of
mounts. Unlike land-based riding, a charac-
ter must have this proficiency (or ride with
someone who does) to handle a flying
mount. In addition, a proficient character
can do the following:
' Leap onto the saddle of the creature
(when it is standing on the ground) and spur
it airborne as a single action. This requires
no proficiency check.
‘ Leap from the back of the mount and
drop 10 feet to the ground or onto the back
of another mount (land-based or flying).
Those with only light encumbrance can
drop to the ground without a proficiency
check. ln all other situations, a proficiency
check is required. A failed roll means the
character takes normal falling damage (for
falling flat on his face) or misses his target
(perhaps taking large amounts of damage as
a result). A character who is dropping to the
ground can attempt an immediate melee
attack. if his proficiency check is made with
a -4 penalty to the ability roll. Failure has
the consequences given above.
‘ Spur his mount to greater speeds on a
successful check. adding 1d4 to the move-
ment rate of the mount. This speed can be
maintained for four consecutive rounds. lf
the check fails, an attempt can be made
again the next round. If two checks fail, no
attempt can be made for a full tum. After
the rounds of increased speed, its movement
drops to 1/; its normal rate and its Maneu-
verability Class (see Glossary) becomes one
class worse. These conditions last until the
mount lands and is allowed to rest for at
least one hour.
' The rider can guide the mount with his
knees and feet. keeping his hands free. A
proficiency check is made only after the
character suffers damage. lf the check is
failed, the character is knocked from the
saddle. A second check is allowed to see if
the character manages to catch himself (thus
hanging from the side by one hand or in
some equally perilous position). If this fails,
the rider falls. Of course a rider can strap
himself into the saddle, although this could
be a disadvantage if his mount is slain and
plummets toward the ground.
Riding, Land-Based: Those skilled in land
riding are proficient in the art of riding and
handling horses or other types of ground
mounts. When the proficiency slot is filled.
the character must declare which type of
mount he is proficient in. Possibilities
include griffons, unicoms, dire wolves, and
virtually any creatures used as mounts by
humans, demihumans, or humanoids.
61
A character with riding proficiency can
perform all of the following feats. Some of
them are automatic. while others require a
proficiency check for success.
' The character can vault onto a saddle
whenever the horse or other mount is stand-
ing still, even when the character is wearing
armor. This does not require a proficiency
check. The character must make a check,
however, if he wishes to get the mount mov-
ing during the same round in which he lands
in its saddle. He must also make a proficien-
cy check if he attempts to vault onto the sad-
dle of a moving mount. Failure indicates
that the character falls to the ground—
presumably quite embarrassed.
' The character can urge the mount to
jump tall obstacles or leap across gaps. No
check is required if the obstacle is less than
three feet tall or the gap is less than 12 feet
wide. if the character wants to roll a profi-
ciency check. the mount can be urged to
leap obstacles up to seven feet high, or jump
across gaps up to 30 feet wide. Success
means that the mount has made the jump.
Failure indicates that it balks. and the char-
acter must make another proficiency check
to see whether he retains his seat or falls to
the ground.
' The character can spur his steed on to
great speeds, adding 6 feet per round to the
animal's movement rate for up to four
tums. This requires a proficiency check



Proflciencles (Nonweapon Proficiency Descriptions
each turn to see if the mount can be pushed
this hard. If the initial check fails. no further
attempts may be made, but the mount can
move normally. lf the second or subsequent
check fails, the mount immediately slows to
a walk, and the character must dismount
and lead the animal for a tum. ln any event.
after four turns of racing, the steed must be
walked by its dismounted rider for one tum.
' The character can guide his mount with
his knees, enabling him to use weapons that
require two hands (such as bows and two-
handed swords) while mounted. This feat
does not require a proﬁciency check unless
the character takes damage while so riding.
ln this case, a check is required and failure
means that the character falls to the ground
and sustains an additional 1d6 points of
damage.
' The character can drop down and hang
alongside the steed. using it as a shield
against attack. The character cannot make
an attack or wear armor while performing
this feat. The character's Armor Class is
lowered by 6 while this maneuver is per-
formed. Any attacks that would have struck
the character's normal Armor Class are con-
sidered to have struck the mount instead.
No proﬁciency check is required.
' The character can leap from the back of
his steed to the ground and make a melee
attack against any character or creature
within 10 feet. The player must roll a suc-
cessful proficiency check with a ~4 penalty
to succeed. On a failed roll, the character
fails to land on his feet, falls clumsily to the
ground, and suffers 1d3 points of damage.
Rope Use: This proficiency enables a
character to accomplish amazing feats with
rope. A character with rope use proﬁciency
is familiar with all sorts of knots and can tie
knots that slip, hold tightly, slide slowly, or
loosen with a quick tug. if the character's
hands are bound and held with a knot, he
can roll a proficiency check (with a -6 pen-
alty) to escape the bonds.
This character gains a +2 bonus to all
attacks made with a lasso. The character
also receives a +10 percent bonus to all
climbing checks made while he is using a
rope, including attempts to belay (semre the
end of a climbing rope) companions.
Running: The character can move at
twice his normal movement rate for a day.
At the end of the day he must sleep for eight
hours. After the first day's movement. the
character must roll a proficiency check for
success. If the die roll succeeds. the charac-
ter can continue his running movement the
next day. if the die roll fails, the character
cannot use his running ability the next day.
if involved in a battle during a day he spent
running. he suffers a -1 penalty to his
attack rolls.
Seamanship: The character is familiar
with boats and ships. He is qualified to
work as a crewman, although he cannot
actually navigate. Crews of trained seamen
are necessary to manage any ship. and they
improve the movemmt rates of inland boats
by 50 percent.
Seanistress/failon The character can sew
and design clothing. He can also do all kinds
of embroidery and ornamental work.
Although no proficiency check is required.
the clutracter must have at least needle and
thread to work.
Set Snares: The character can make sim-
ple snares and traps, primarily to catch
small game. These can include rope snares
and spring traps. A proficiency check must
be rolled when the snare is ﬁrst constructed
and every time the snare is set. A failed pro-
ﬁciency check means the trap docs not work
for some reason. lt may be that the work-
manship was bad, the character left too
much scent in the area, or he poorly con-
cealed the finished work. The exact nature
of the problem does not need to be known.
The character can also attempt to set traps
and snares for larger creatures: tiger pits
and net snares, for example. A proficiency
check must be rolled, this time with a -4
penalty to the ability score. in both cases.
setting a successful snare does not ensure
that it catches anything, only that the snare
works if triggered. The DM must decide if
the trap is triggered.
Thief characters (and only thieves) with
this proficiency can also attempt to rig man-
traps. These can involve such things as
crossbows, deadfalls. spiked springboards,
etc. The procedure is the same as that for
setting a large snare. The DM must deter-
mine the amount of damage caused by a
man-trap.
Setting a small snare or trap takes one
hour of work. Setting a larger trap requires
two to three people (only one need have the
proficiency) and 2d4 hours of work. Setting
a man-trap requires one or more people
(depending on its nature] and 1d8 hours of
work. To prepare any trap. the character
must have appropriate materials on hand.
Characters with animal lore proficiency
gain a + 2 bonus to their ability score when
attempting to set a snare for the purposes of
catching game. Their knowledge of animals
and the woods serves them well for this pur-
pose. They gain no benefit when attempting
to trap monsters or intelligent beings.
Singing: The character is an accom-
plished singer and can use this ability to
entertain others and perhaps earn a small
living (note that bards can do this automati-
cally). No proficiency check is required to
sing. The character can also create choral
works on a successful proficiency Check.
Spellcrafiz Although this proficiency does
not grant the character any spellcasting
powers, it does give him familiarity with the
different forms and rites of spellcasting. If
he observes and overhears someone who is
casting a spell. or if he examines the material
63
components used. he can attempt to identify
the spell being cast. A proficiency check
must be rolled to make a correct identifica-
tion. Wizard specialists gain a +3 bonus to
the check when attempting to identify magic
of their own school. Note that since the
spellcaster must be observed until the very
instant of casting, the spellcraft proficiency
does not grant an advantage against combat
spells. The proficiency is quite useful. how-
ever, for identifying spells that would other-
wise have no visible effect.
Those talented in this proficiency also
have a chance (equal to ‘/1 of their normal
proficiency check) of recognizing magical or
magically endowed constructs for what
they are.
Stonemasonry: A stonemason is able to
build structures from stone so that they last
many years. He can do simple stone carv-
ings, such as lettering, columns, and flour-
ishes. The stone can be mortared, carefully
ﬁtted without mortar, or loosely fitted and
chinked with rocks and earth. A stonemas-
on equipped with his tools (hammers,
chisels, wedges, block and tackle) can build
a plain section of wall one foot thick. ten
feet long, and five feet high in one day. pro-
vided the stone has already been cut. A
stonemason can also supervise the work of
unskilled laborers to quarry stone; one
stonerruason is needed for every five labor-
ers. Dwarves are among the most accom-
plished stonemasons in the world; they
receive a +2 bonus when using this skill.
Survival: This proficiency must be
applied to a specific environment—i.e., a
speciﬁc type of terrain and weather factors.
Typical environments include arctic. wood-
land, desert. steppe, mountain, or tropical.
The character has basic survival knowledge
for that terrain type. Additional proficiency
slots can be used to add more types of ter-
rain.
A character skilled in survival has a basic
knowledge of the hazards he might face in
that land. He understands the effects of the
weather and knows the proper steps to
lessen the risk of exposure. He knows the
methods to locate or gather drinkable
water. He knows how to ﬁnd basic, not nec-
essarily appetizing, food where none is
apparent. thus staving off starvation. Fur-
thermore. a character with survival skill can
instruct and aid others in the same situation.
When using the proficiency to find food or
water, the character must roll a proﬁciency
check. If the check is failed, no more
attempts can be made that day.
The survival skill in no way releases the
player characters from the hardships and
horrors of being lost in the wilderness. At
best it alleviates a small portion of the suf-
fering. The food found is barely adequate,
and water is discovered in miniscule
amounts. lt is still quite possible for a char-
acter with survival knowledge to die in the



Proﬂciencies (Nonweapon Proficiency Descriptions)
wildemess. indeed, the little knowledge the
character has may lead to overconfidence
and dooml
Swimming: A character with swimming
proficiency knows how to swim and can
move according to the rules given in the
Swimming section (page 120). Those with-
out this proficiency cannot swim. They can
hold their breath and ﬂoat, but they cannot
move themselves about in the water.
Tightrope Walking: The character can
attempt to walk narrow ropes or beams
with greater than normal chances of suc-
cess. He can negotiate any narrow surface
not angled up or down greater than 45
degrees. Each round the character can walk
60 feet. One proficiency check is made eve-
ry 6O feet (or part thereof), with failure indi-
cating a fall. The check is made with a -10
penalty to the ability score if the surface is
one inch or less in width (a rope), a -5 pen-
alty if two inches to six inches wide, and
unmodiﬁed if seven inches to 12 inches
wide. Wider than one foot requires no check
for proficient characters under nonnal cir-
cumstances. Every additional proficiency
spent on tightrope walking reduces these
penalties by 1. Use of a balancing rod reduc-
es the penalties by 2. Winds or vibrations in
the line increases the penalties by 2 to 6.
The character can attempt to fight while
on a tightrope, but he suffers a -5 penalty
to his attack roll and must roll a successful
proficiency check at the beginning of each
round to avoid failing off. Since the charac-
ter cannot maneuver, he gains no adjust-
ments to his Armor Class for Dexterity. If he
is st-ruck while on the rope, he must roll an
immediate proficiency check to retain his
balance.
Tracking: Characters with tracking profi-
ciency are able to follow the trail of crea-
tures and characters across most types of
terrain. Characters who are not rangers roll
a proficiency check with a -6 penalty to
their ability scores; rangers have no penalty
to their ability scores. ln addition, other
modifiers are also applied to the attempt,
according to Table 39.
Table 39: TRACKING MODIFIERS
Terrain Mod.
Soft or muddy ground +4
Thick brush, vines, or reeds +3
Occasional signs of passage, dust +2
Normal ground, wood floor 0
Rocky ground or shallow water -10
Every two creatures in the group +1
Everyllhourssincetrailwasmade -1
Every hour of rain, snow, or sleet -5
Poor lighting (moon or starlight) —
Tracked party attempm to hide trail -
The modifiers in Table 39 are cum-
ulative—-total the modifiers for all condi-
tions that apply and combine that with the
tracker's Wisdom score to get the modiﬁed
Ul0~
chance to track.
For example, if Thule's Wisdom score is
16 and he is trying to track through mud
(+4), at night (-6), during a sleet storm
(-5), his chance to track is 9 (16 4' 4 -6
-5). (Thule is a ranger, so he does not suffer
the -6 penalty for non-rangers tracking.)
For tracking to succeed, the creature
tracked must leave some type of trail. Thus
it is virtually impossible to track flying or
noncorporeal creatures. The DM may allow
this in rare instances, but he should also
assign substantial penalties to the attempt.
To track a creature. the character must
first find the trail. indoors, the tracker must
have seen the creature in the last 30 minutes
and must begin tracking from the place last
seen. Outdoors, the tracker must either
have seen the creature, have eyewitness
reports of its recent movement ("Yup, we
saw them orcs just high-tail it up that trail
there not but yesterday"), or must have
obvious evidence that the creature is in the
area (such as a well-used game trail). if these
conditions are met, a proficiency check is
rolled. Success means a trail has been
found. Failure means no trail is found.
Another attempt cannot be made until the
above conditions are met again under differ-
ent circumstances.
Once the trail is found, additional profi-
ciency checks are rolled for the following
situations:
' The chance to track decreases (terrain,
rain, creatures leaving the group, darkness,
etc.).
' A second track crosses the first.
' The party resumes tracking after a halt
(to rest, eat, fight, etc.).
Once the tradcer fails a proficiency check,
another check can be rolled after spending
at least one hour searching the area for new
signs. If this check is failed, no further
attempts can be made. lfseveral trackers are
following a trail, a + 1 bonus is added to the
ability score of the most adept tracker. Once
he loses the trail, it is lost to all.
if the modifiers lower the chance to track
below 0 (e.g., the modiﬁers are - 11 and the
character's Wisdom is 10), the trail is totally
lost to that character and further tracking is
impossible (even if the chance later
improves). Other characters may be able to
continue tracking, but that character can-
not.
A tracking diaracter can also attempt to
identify the type of creatures being followed
and the approximate number by rolling a
proficiency check. All the normal tracking
modifiers apply. One identifying check can
be rolled each time a check is rolled to foi-
low the trail. A successful check identifies
the creatures (provided the character has
some knowledge of that type of creature)
and gives a rough estimate of their numbers.
Iust how accurate this estimate is depends
on the DM.
64
When following a trail, the character (and
those with him) must slow down, the speed
depending on the character's modified
chance to track as found from Table 39.
Table 40: MOVEMENT WHILE
TRACKING
Chance to Track Movement Rate
1-6 1/4 normal
7-14 1/2 normal
14 or greater 3/4 normal
In the earlier example, Thule has a modi-
fied tracking chance of 9, so he moves at ‘/2
his normal movement rate.
Tumbling: The character is practiced in
all manner of iC'l'OlJiliCS—diVQS» rolls, som-
ersaults, handstands, flips, etc. Tumbling
can only be performed while burdened with
light encumbrance or less. Aside from enter-
taining, the character with tumbling profi-
ciency can improve his Annor Class by 4
against attacks directed solely at him in any
round of combat, provided he has the initia-
tive and foregoes all attacks that round.
When in unarmed combat he can improve
his attack roll by 2.
On a successful proficiency check, he suf-
fers only one-half the normal damage from
falls of 60 feet or less and none from falls of
10 feet or less. Falls from greater heights
result in nonnal damage.
Ventriioqnisrn: The character has learned
the secrets of "throwing his voice." Al-
though not actually making sound come
from somewhere else (like the spell), the
character can deceive others into believing
this to be so. When using ventriloquism, the
supposed source of the sound must be rela-
tively close to the character. The nature of
the speaking object and the intelligence of
those watching can modify the character's
chance of success. If the character makes an
obviously inanimate object talk (a book,
mug, etc.). a -5 penalty is applied to his
ability score. If a believable source (a PC or
NPC) is made to appear to speak, a +2
bonus is added to his ability score. The
pbservefs intelligence modiﬁes this as fol-
ows:
Intelligence Modifier
less than 3 + 6
3-5 '5' 4
6-8 + 2
9-14 0
15-16 - 1
1 7-15 -
19 '5' -
A successful proficiency check means the
character has succssfully deceived his audi-
ence. One check must be made for evnry
sentence or response. The character is lim-
ited to sounds he could nonnally make (thus
the roar of a lion is somewhat beyond him).
Since ventriloquism relies on deception,
people's knowledge of speech, and assump-
AM



Proﬂclencles (Nonweapon Proficiency Descriptions
tions about what should and shouldn't talk,
it is effective only on intelligent creatures.
Thus it has no effect on animals and the like.
Furthermore, the audience must be watch-
ing the character since part of the deception
is visual ("Hey, his lips don't movel"). Using
ventriloquism to get someone to look
behind him does not work, since the voice is
not actually behind him (this requires the
ventriloquism spell). All but those with the
gullibility of children realize what is tru.ly
happening. They may be amused—or they
may not be.
Weaponsmithlng: This highly specialized
proficiency enables a character to perform
the difficult and highly exacting work
involved in making metal weapons, particu-
larly those with blades. The character
blends some of the skill of the blacksmith
with an ability to create blades of strength
and sharpness. A fully equipped smithy is
necessary to use this proﬁciency.
The time and cost to make various types
of weapons are listed on Table 41.

Weather Sense: This proficiency enables
the character to make intelligent guesses
about upcoming weather conditions. A suc-
cessful proficiency check means the charac-
ter has correctly guessed the genera] weath-
er conditions in the next six hours. A failed
check means the character read the signs
wrong and forecast the weather incorrectly.
The DM should roll the dieck secretly. A
proficiency check can be made once every
six hours. However, for every six hours of
observation, the character gains a + 1 bonus
to his ability score (as he watches the weath-
er change, the character gets a better sense
of What is coming). This modifier is cumula-
tive, although sleep or other activity that
occupies the attention of the character for a
long period negates any accumulated
bonus.
Sometimes impending weather condi-
tions are so obvious that no proficiency
check is required. It is difficult not to notice
the tomado funnel tearing across the plain
or the mass of dark clouds on the horizon
obviously headed the character's way. ln
these cases, the player should be able to
deduce what is about to happen to his char-
acter anyway.
Weuvlng: A character with weaving pro-
ficiency is able to create garments. tapes-
tries, and draperies from wool or cotton.
The character requires a spinning apparatus
and a loom. A weaver can create two square
yards of material per day.

X Chapter 6= Money and Equipment
Although your character has some impres-
sive abilities and skills, he really isn't going
to be effective without the equipment neces-
sary for adventuring. To get this equipment,
he needs money. Not only does he need
money to outfit himself, but your character
also has to cover his living expenses.
Although there are many different types
of coins and currencies in the world, all
prices and treasures in the AD&D“‘ rules are
given in standard coinage. Your DM may
have speciﬁc names for different coins and
may have different rates of exchange, but
this is material particular to his campaign.
He will tell you if there are differences from
the coins listed here. The standard rate of
exchange for each coin is given in Table 42.
The basic coins are the copper piece (cpl
and the silver piece (sp). These form the
backbone of the monetary system and are
the coins most frequently found in the
hands of the common folk. Above these two
coins is the much rarer gold piece (gp). This
coin is seldom found in common use and
mainly exists on paper as the standard
money of account. This means it is used to
measure the value of property and goods.
Land values. ship cargoes, gemstones. and
penalty bonds (royal court fines) are nor-
mally calculated in gold pieces, although
payment of such vast sums normally takes
other forms.
In addition to these coins, there are other
unusual metals used in exchange. Most of
these come from failed currencies. As such,
they are viewed with skepticism by many
honest folk. Principal among these coins are
the electrum (99) and platinum pieces (PP).
These coins are rarely circulated, and most are
hidden away in andent treasure hoards.
The value of each coin can also be figured
by the following: 10 cp = 1 sp; 5 sp = 1 ep;
Zep = 1gp;5gp I lpp.
However, remember that not all wealth is
measured by coins. Wealth can take many
forms—land, livestock, the right to collect
taxes or customs, and jewelry are all mea-
sures of wealth. Coins have no guaranteed
value. A gold piece can buy a lot in a small
village but won't go very far in a large city.
This makes other forms of wealth, land for
instance, all the more valuable. Indeed.
many a piece of jewelry is actually a way of
carrying one's wealth. Silver annbands can
be traded for goods, a golden brooch can
buy a cow, etc. ln your adventures, wealth
and riches may take many different forms.
Furthermore, in your DM's campaign,
there may be special situations or consider-
ations to bear in mi.nd. The Kingdom of
Gonfli may be at war with the neighboring
Principality of Boosk. Patriotic Gonflians
might refuse Boosk coins (probably because
they think the coins are worthless). Practi-
cal Booskites might accept the Gonfli florin
at half non-nal value (so they can melt them
down and mint new Boosk drachmas). Of

course, both groups would send your char-
acter to the local money changer (if there is
one). who would cheerfully convert your
foreign coins to the local tender. He will, of
course, charge a small commission (10-
30%) for this service.
Situations such as these can affect the val-
ue of any coin. If your characters start flash-
ing about a lot of gold, pumping it into the
local economy, merchants will quickly raise
prices. As another example, the local lord
may commandeer most of the region's
horses for his knights, making those left all
that much more expensive.
Starting Money
All player charac-
ters begin with some amount of cash. This
nest egg may be your character's life sav-
ings. It may be a gift from his parents to
start him out in the world. lt may be his
booty from an anny campaign. Perhaps he
stumbled across a small treasure chest,
whetting his appetite for greater and more
dangerous prizes. How he came by his
money is not important (although it may be
fun to know). You are free to create any
explanation you want.
To learn your character's starting funds.
roll the dice indicated for his group in Table
43. This is the number of gold pieces your
character has to obtain equipment. lf you
are creating a character starting out at a
level above 1st level, check with the DM to
see if you can increase your character's
funds beyond the amounts given here.
Multi-class characters use the most
advantageous die range of their classes.

Character Group Die Range
Warrior 5d4 X 1Ogp
Wizard (1d4 +1) X 10 gp
Rogue 2d6 X 10 gp
Priest ' 3d6 >< lOgp
' Priest characters can use their money
only to purchase equipment and goods.
Once all purchases are made, the priest
character must retum all but two or three of
his remaining gold pieces to his superiors
(since his equipment is supplied by his orga-
nization). Priests cannot lend any of their
initial funds to other characters.
66
Equipment Lists
The following lists
include much of the equipment your charac-
ter needs for adventuring. The most basic of
these are weapons. armor, clothing. and
outﬁtting gear. The other lists provide
goods and services your character may need
during the course of his many adventures.
While most items are always available, your
DM may add to or delete from these lists.
What you want may not be available or, if
your DM has set his game in a speciﬁc time
period. may not have been discovered or
invented yetl While he should tell you
which items are and aren't available. you
should ask if you have any doubts, particu-
larly on large purchases.
Many of the uncommon items in these
lists are explained in the following pages.
The price given for each item in the lists is
its average price, the amount you can expect
the item to cost in a normal economy. How-
ever, large cities, barren wildernesses, and
places with brave adventurers carrying bags
full of gold are not normal economies. in
these places you may find yourself paying
more (very rarely less) than the amount list-
ed. You can also haggle with merchants over
prices. although to speed up the game it's
recommended that you save this for your
important purchases. If you wind up hag-
gling over the cost of every tankard of ale,
your character is going to spend more time
being a pennypincher than an adventurer!

“ROF" is the rate of fire-—how many shots
that weapon can fire off in one round. This
is independent of the number of melee
attacks a character can make in a round.
Range is given in tens of yards. Fach
range category (Short, Medium. or Long)
includes attacks from distances equal to or
less than the given range. Thus a heavy
crossbow fired at a target 136 yards away
uses the medium-range modiﬁer.
The modifiers for range are - 2 for medi-
um range and -5 for long range.
Arquebuses (if allowed) double all range
modiﬁers.
Equipment Descriptions
Not every piece of
equipment is described here. The vast
majority of things found on the equipment
lists need no description, as their functions.
forms, and purposes are obvious. Only
those items whose use is obscure or appear-
ance is unusual are described below. Spe-
ciﬁc game effects of equipment are given in
the appropriate sections of the niles.
Tack and Harness
Barding: A war
horse. or any animal trained for combat, is
a considerable investment for the average
warrior. Therefore it behooves the owner to
see that his mount is as well-protected as
possible. Other than avoiding risks, the best
nonmagical protection is horse armor or
barding. Barding is simply some type oi
armor fitted to be wom by the mount. Full
barding covers the neck, chest, and body of
the beast, while half barding covers the
head, neck, chest, and front quarters. Bard-
ing can be made from many different mate-
rials; stouter types provide increasing
protection according to the Armor Class of
the construction. All of this, however, is at
the expense of increased weight and lowered
maneuverability of the mount. Plate bard-
ing, for example, is the equivalent of a war-
rior's ﬁeld plate and is made of carefully
interlocked plates and joints. It provides an
Armor Class of Z to the mount. it weighs at
least 80 to 100 pounds at the lightest and
thus a fully equipped war horse with this
armor can manage little more than a steady
trot at top speed.
Barded animals also require special atten-
tion. Care must be taken to prevent chafing
and sores. The mount cannot wear the
armor indefinitely. lt must be removed at
night and ideally should not be wom except
in preparation for a battle or toumament.
Removing horse barding takes 15 minutes
for leather and 30 minutes for metal armors.
Fitting it on takes twice as long. The weight
of barding is carefully distributed to
account for the weight of the armor and the
rider, so barded animals cannot be used as
Equipment (Descriptions) J’
pack animals! lt is normal practice to have a
second mount for carrying gear and sup-
plies.
When barding is fitted over a mount
whose natural Annor Class is better than
the barding, some protection is still gained.
This is explained under Armor on page 76.
ln addition to horses and elephants, it
may be possible to fit barding on more
fantastic mounts. Flying steeds can wear
only leather or magical barding. Aquatic
creatures cannot wear normal barding
although extremely rare magical pieces may
exist. Other land creatures can certainly be
barded, provided your DM niles that they
are sturdy enough to carry the weight of
armor and rider. Camels, for instance, are
seldom barded for this reason. A huge
ostrich would not be able to carry barding,
since its legs would not support the weight.
Saddles: There two basic saddles—riding
and pack. Riding saddles take many forms,
but their basic purpose is to carry a person.
if your DM has set his campaigi in an
ancient or early Medieval setting, saddles
may be without stirrups. Ask your DM to
be sure. Pack saddles are special frames
designed to can-y supplies and equipment.
The only practical limit to how much a well-
stowed pack saddle can carry is the carrying
ability of the animal,
Transport
Caravel: This ship
was sailed in late Medieval/early Renais-
sance times and was the type of ship Colum-
bus used to reach the New World. (lt should
be used only in late Medieval settings.) lt
normally has two or three masts and square
sails. No oars are used. The typical caravel
is 70 feet long and Z0 feet wide. The nonnal
<.1'ew is from 30 to 40 men. The average car-
go displacement is 150-200 tons.
Coaster: Also called a round ship, this is a
small merchant ship that hugs the coasts.
This is a sailing ship, fitted with two masts
and triangular sails. The average size is 60 to
70 feet long and 20 feet wide. The rudder
hangs from one side. The crew is Z0 to 30
men, and the cargo capacity is about 100
tons. Normally there is only a small stem-
castle. A coaster is slow and not tremen-
dously seaworthy, but it can carry large
amounts of cargo with smaller crews than
galleys.
Cog: This ship is a larger, improved ver-
sion of the coaster, able to make ventures
into the open sea. Like the coaster, it is a
sailing ship with one or two masts, but the
cog employs square sails. It is about 75 to 90
feet long and 20 feet wide. The crew is only
18 to 20 men. There is normally one deck
and fore- and stemcastles. The cargo capac-
ities of cogs vary greatly, but the average is
100 to 200 tons.
Currach: This ship is an early, primitive
7|
vessel. it is made from thick hides stretched
over a wood-and-wicker frame. A single
mast carries a small square sail, but the cur-
ragh is usually worked by oars. lt is nonnal-
ly 20 to 40 feet long. The crew is approx-
imately six to eight and the cargo space is
limited—no more than five tons.
Dralckar: The largest of the Viking long-
ships is known as a drakkar or dragonship.
Built for war, this ship stretches about 100
feet in length. Although a single mast can be
raised, oars provide the main source of
power. The crew of 60 to 80 men rows, one
man to an oar. Up to 160 additional men can
be carried for boarding and raiding. Due to
its great size, a drakkar is not very seawor-
thy. This and the fact that there is no space
on board for many supplies (certainly not
enough for 240 men) or sleeping quarters
keep the drakkar close to the coast where it
can put in for the night. Because of its cost
and limited use, a drakkar is usually built by
kings and rulers and is not used for the mun-
dane task of shipping cargo.
Dromond: This ship is the largest of the
Byzantine galleys. Although it boasts one or
two masts and triangular sails, the main
power comes from the 100 oars, 50 to a side.
These oars are divided into an upper and
lower bank, with one man per oar on the
lower bank and three men on the upper
bank. Thus. the total crew is about 200
men. The dromond is about 130 to 175 feet
long and 15 feet wide, making it a very slen-
der ship. The cargo capacity is around 70 to
100 tons.
A dromond can be used both for shipping
and war. As a warship. a ram projects from
the front just above the water line. Castles
are built fore, aft, and amidships as firing
platforms. The cargo space is then taken up
by marines. With such numbers of men, it is
a very dangerous ship to attack. A dromond
is not a seaworthy craft, however, and usu-
ally sails in sight of shore. They beach at
night like all galleys, since supplies and
sleeping accommodations are very limited.
Galleon: This is the largest and most
advanced sailing ship that might be availa-
ble in the AD&D° game. it should appear
only in Renaissance-period settings. It is a
sail-driven ship with three or four masts.
There are normally three through decks
(ninning the length of the ship), while the
castles fore and aft have two decks. The
average size is about 130 feet long and 30
feet wide. Crews average about 130 men.
Although cargo capacity is about 500 tons,
a galleon is mainly used as a warship. (ln the
real world they were fitted with cannon,
something beyond the standard AD&D@
game rules.) They can easily carry men
equal to their tonnage. making capture by
pirates nearly impossible.
Great Galley: Built during the Late Mid-
dle Ages, the great galley is an improved
version of the dromond. lt is slightly smaller



  Equipment (Descriptions)
than the dromond. about 130 feet long and
20 feet wide. The main power comes from
140 rowers, one man to an oar but is supple-
mented by three masts; this combination
gives it better speed and handling. The car-
go capacity is 150 tons. When outfitted as a
warship, the front end is built as a ram and
marines are carried instead of cargo. Like all
galleys, the great galley is a coastal vessel,
rarely venturing into open water. lt is not
seaworthy in heavy storms and waits in
port for these to pass.
Knan: This small ship was a common car-
go ship of the Scandinavian region. lt is 50
to 75 feet long and 15 to 20 feet wide. lt has a
single mast and a square sail. ln times of
poor wind, a few oars at the bow and stern
can provide more power. The crew ranges
from eight to 14 men. The cargo capacity is
small, anywhere from ten to S0 tons. The
ship is, however, relatively seaworthy and
can be used to make long sea voyages
(although it cannot be called comfortable).
lts ﬂat bottom makes it useful for sailing up
rivers and estuaries. and it can be beached
easily.
Longship: This is the standard Viking
warship. lt is more substantial than the
knarr but not nearly as massive as the
drakkar. An average longship is 75 feet long
with 20 to 25 oars per side. Each oar is
worked by a single man for a total crew of
40 to 50 men. There is also a single mast and
a square sail. In addition to the crew, the
ship can carry an additional 120 to 150 men.
A longship can be used for shipping, but its
cargo capacity is only about 50 tons. lt is,
however, fairly seaworthy and can sail
across the open sea when necessary.
Miscellaneous Equipment
Holy Item: Holy
items are small representations of all those
things revered by religions—stars, crosses,
hammers, rosaries, anointed oils, blessed
wine, sacred teachings, and more. lust what
constitutes a holy item depends on the cam-
paign your character is in. All good holy
items have similar effects on undead and
other evil creatures. provided they are
wielded by a follower of a belief associated
with these items. Thus, rules that refer to
holy symbols and holy water apply to all
similar items, provided these items are spe-
cially prepared by the cleric’s order.
Because of their special nature, holy items
cannot normally be purchased. Different
sects tend to protect the symbols of their
faith to prevent their misuse or corruption.
Therefore such items must be obtained
through the auspices of a local congrega-
tion. This is not difficult for sincere fol-
lowers of that faith, although requests for
rare or unusual items must always be justi-
fied. Nonbelievers are given holy items only
71
if there is a clear and present danger to the
faith.
Lanterns: A hooded lantern (30-foot radi-
us of light) is a standard lantern with shut-
tered or hinged sides. lt is not directional, as
its light is cast equally in all directions. A
bullseye lantern (60-foot radius of light) has
only a single shutter, the other sides being
highly polished to reﬂect the light in a single
direction. Both hooded and bullseye lan-
terns can be carried in one hand. A single
flask of oil (one pint) bums for six hours in
either.
The beacon lantern (Z40-foot radius of
light) is a much larger affair and must be
mounted on the prow of a ship, the bed of a
wagon, or other large structure. lt operates
like the bullseye lantern but illuminates to a
greater distance. The beacon goes through
oil quickly, buming a ﬂask every two hours.
Locks: Locks are still fairly primitive
affairs (except for those complicated by the
use of magic). All are worked with a large
bulky key. Combination locks are virtually
unknown at this time. As with most things,
there are good, very complex locks as well
as bad, easily opened locks.
Magnifying Glass: This simple lens is
more an oddity than a useful tool. lt does
not greatly enhance viewing. especially
since many are unevenly ground, creating
distortion. lt is useful as a substitute for tin-
der and steel when starting fires.



Merchant's Scale: This is a small balance
and pans along with a suitable assortment
of weights. its main use is to weigh coins-
a common method of settling a transac-
tion. Merchants are well aware that coins
can be undersized, shaved, or plated. The
only sound protection is to check the coins
against a set of established weights. It is
also needed when using foreign coins to
make a purchase or exchange. Of course.
merchants are no more noble than anyone
else and may use sets of false weights-—one
set heavier than normal for selling an item
(causing the customer to pay more) and an-
other set lighter than usual for buying
items (letting the merchant pay less). ln
well-regulated areas, officials verity the ac-
curacy of weights and measures, but this in
itself is no protection. Players may wish to
have a scale and weights for their own pro-
tection.
Cil: Greek fire is a general name given to
all highly ﬂammable oils used in combat.
(Historically, Greek fire was a special com-
bination of oil and chemicals that was sticky
and difficult to extinguish.) These oils are
highly ﬂammable and a little dangerous to
carry. Lump oil is used for lamps and lan-
terns. lt is not particularly explosive al-
though it can be used to feed an existing
blaze.
Spyghss: Like the magnifying glass, the
spyglass is more of an oddity than a useful
item. Objects viewed through it are a little
closer, although not much. For better re-
sults, magical items are preferred. The spy-
glass gives from two to three times
magnification.
Thieves’ Picks: This is a small collection
of tools useful to burglars. The kit includes
one or more skeleton keys, long metal
picks, a long-nosed clamp, a small hand
saw, and a small wedge and hammer. These
combined with some common tools (such as
a crowbar) make up most of the special
equipment a thief needs to perform his
trade.
Water Clock: This bulky item is good for
giving the time accurate to a half-hour. Acti-
vated by a regulated flow of drops, the wa-
ter clock is not something you carry in your
pocket. For it to work at all, it must have a
source of water and be left undisturbed. A
very uncommon item, it is primarily an
amusement for the wealthy and a tool for
the student of arcane lore. The vast major-
ity of society is not concerned with exact
time.
Weapons
The Weapons Table
lists more than just the price of each item. It
also gives other game information. Since
each weapon is different, you should note
this information separately for each weapon
your character purchases or finds.
Equipment (Descriptions) 
Weapon Size: All weapons are classed ac-
cording to a size category—S, M, L, G, or
H. Small (S) weapons are approximately
two feet or less in size; medium (M) weap-
ons are two to five feet long; large (L) weap-
ons are generally six feet or greater in
length. Giant (G) and huge (H) weapons are
not found on the lists, since these are items
normally used by ogres, giants, and even
greater creatures. They are not items of
equipment a PC can nonnally buy!
A character can always wield a weapon
equal to his own size or less. Nonnally this
requires only one hand, except for some
missile weapons (bows and crossbows in
particular). A character can also use a
weapon one size greater than himself al-
though it must be gripped with two hands.
Beyond this size limit, the weapon is not us-
able without special means (most often
magical).
Drelb the halfling (size S) can use a short
sword with no difficulty (a size S weapon).
or a long sword with two hands (a size M
weapon), but a glaive (size L) is just too
large for him to wield. Likewise, he can use
a short bow but is unable to handle a long
bow.
Type: Weapons are classified according to
types—bludgeoning (B), piercing (P), and
slashing (S). These types are used to deter-
mine armor type modifiers (if these are
used). Weapons vs. Armor Type is ex-
plained in Chapter 9: Combat (Pige B9).
Speed Factor: Weapon speed is a relative
measure of the clumsiness of the weapon.
The lower the number, the quicker and eas-
ier the weapon is to use. Weapon speed is ex-
plained in Chapter 9; Combat.
Damage: All weapons are rated for the
amount of damage they can cause to small-
and medium-sized creatures (S-M) and
larger-than-man-sized creatures (L).
Arquebus: This weapon may be disal-
lowed by your DM and you must check
with him before you purchase it. An arque-
bus is an early form of the musket, almost
as dangerous to its user as it is to the target.
To use an arquebus, you must have a sup-
ply of powder and shot and a piece of slow-
buming match or cord. These items may or
may not be commonly available. (Powder
is treated as a magical item in these rules.)
The weapon can be fired only once every
three rounds, and then only if the character
is not attacked while loading. When firing
an arquebus, all penalties for range are
doubled.
lf the attack roll for the arquebus is a 1 or
2, the weapon backfires, causing 1d6 points
of damage to the firer. lt is also fouled and
cannot be used again until it has been
cleaned, which takes about 30 minutes.
When a arquebus scores a hit, it normally
does 1 to 9 points of damage on 1d1O. When
a 10 is rolled, the die is rolled again and this
73
amount is added to 10. Each time a 10 is
rolled, the die is rolled again and added to
the previous total. Thus, in a rare instance,
a single shot could inﬂict 37 points, for ex-
ample, if three consecutive 10s were rolled,
followed by a 7. The damage caused by an
arquebus is never modified for a high
Strength score.
Bows: Bows come in various shapes and
sizes. The power of a bow is measured by its
pull. The greater the pull, the more Strength
needed to work the bow. Thus it is possible
for characters to have bows that grant them
damage bonuses for high Strength (it is as-
sumed the character has chosen a bow that
has a greater pull). Likewise, characters
with low Strengths stiffer their usual penal-
ties when using a bow (they are forced to use
weaker bows or simply cannot draw back as
far). The pull of a bow seldom prevents a
character from using the weapon, only from
gaining the full effect. The true test of a
character's Strength comes in stringing a
bow—the bow of a strong hero may simply
be unstringable by a lesser man (as was
OdysseuS's).
Heavier pull bows are not normally any
more expensive than standard bows. The
exceptions to this are those bows that enable
the fighter to gain bonuses for exceptional
Strength (18/O1 or greater). These bows
must be custom crafted and cost three to
five times the normal price. These bows are
also difficult to string or use effectively for
those without exceptional Strength. These
characters must roll a successful bend barsl
lift gates roll to string or use such weapons
(again, think of the test of the suitors in
Odysseus's household).
Arrows for long bows of all types are di-
vided between light-weight ﬂight arrows
and heavier sheaf arrows. Flight arrows
have longer ranges and are normally used in
hunting. Sheaf arrows have a stronger metal
head but a reduced range. They are often
used in times of war.
Crossbow: Strength bonuses or penalties
do not apply to crossbows, since these are
purely mechanical devices. The hand cross-
bow is easily held in one hand and cocked
with the other. The light crossbow, also
called latches, must be braced against an ob-
ject to be cocked with a lever mounted on
the stock. The heavy crossbow, also called
arbalest, has a powerful pull and must be
cocked with a cranequin (a simple winch or
lever) that comes with the weapon. One
foot is placed in a stirrup at the end of the
crossbow while the cranequin is worked.
All crossbows fire quarrels or bolts and the
correct size must be used with each weapon.
Lance: The different lances are rated ac-
cording to size and sturdiness. Each type
can be used only if the rider is on the same
type of horse or a greater one. A man on a
light war horse could not use a heavy horse
lance, if only because the impact would



 Equipment (Descriptions)
bowl him and the horse right over! Further-
more, the heavy and jousting lances require
that the rider is ﬁrmly in a saddle and using
stirrups. The jousting lance is a heavy horse
lance modified for use in toumaments, in
which the desire is not to kill the opponent.
The end of the lance is fitted with a special
blunted tip intended to lessen the chance of
wounds. Of course. good intentions often
go awry, so there is still a chance of injury
during a joust.
Mancatchen This item is a highly special-
ized type of polearm designed to capture
without killing a victim. lt consists of a long
pole with a spring-loaded set of sharpened
jaws at the end. The victim is caught
between the arms, which then snap shut.
The mancatcher is effective only on man-
sized creatures. The target is always treated
as AC 10, modified for Dexterity. lf a hit is
scored, the character is caught. The caught
victim loses all shield and Dexterity bonuses
and can be pushed and pulled about. This
causes an automatic 1d2 points of damage
per round and gives a 25% chance of pulling
the victim to the ground. The victim can
escape on a successful bend bars/lift gates
roll, although this results in 1d2 points more
damage. A common tactic is to use the
weapon to pull horsemen off their mounts,
then pin them to the ground.
Polearn-is: A popular group of weapons
during the ancient and Medieval periods
were the polearms. Their length was a dis-
tinct advantage and, for the peasant, they
were a relatively easy weapon to make.
Thus there came to be an abundance of
polearms of different sizes and shapes. Due
to their numbers, there is no standard sys-
tem for naming polearms. The names used
in the ADkD@ game might possibly be
applied to other weapons elsewhere.
Because of their length. all polearms are
infantry weapons and require two hands to
use. They are almost always the weapon of
the common peasant and soldier, who, lack-
ing a horse and heavy annor, needs some
weapon to keep the enemy's knights at bay.
Thus most poleanns are intended to be used
in close-packed fonnations that present a
forest of sharp points and wicked blades to
any knight foolish enough to charge.
Awl Pike: Essentially this is a long spear
12 to 20 feet long ending in a spike point of
tapered spear head. lt was a popular weap-
on during the Renaissance. Since the pike
stuck out in front, men could be packed
side-by-side in dense formations. and sev-
eral rows of men could fight. Large blocks
of pikemen made formidable troops. How-
ever, once the pikemen engaged in close
combat, they normally dropped their clum-
sy awl pikes and fought hand-to-hand with
short swords.
Bardiche: One of the simplest of
poleanns, the bardiche is ar\ elongated bat-
tle axe. A large curving axe-head is mounted
on the end of a five- to eight-foot-long shaft.
It probably grew out of common peasant
tools and was popular with them. One rela-
tive disadvantage is that the bardiche
required more space to wield than a pike or
a spear.
Bec de corbin: This was a highly special-
ized weapon of the upper classes during the
Late Middle Ages and the early Renais-
sance. lt is an early can-opener designed
specifically to deal with plate armor. The
pick or beak is made to punch through
plate, while the hammer side can be used to
give a stiff blow. The end is fitted with a
short blade for dealing with unarmored or
helpless foes. The weapon is about eight feet
long. Since the weapon relies on impact, a
great deal of swinging space is needed.
Bil]-gnisarme: A particularly bizarre-
looking combination weapon, the bill-
guisarme is an outgrowth of the common
bill hook. Mounted on a seven- to eight-
foot-long pole, it has a combination of a
heavy, cleaver blade, a jutting back spike,
and a hook or spike on the end. Thus. it can
be used in several different ways. Like most
polearms, it requirs lots of room to use.
Pluchard: An outgrowth of the sickle and
scythe. the fauchard is a long. inward curv-
ing blade mounted on a shaft six to eight feet
long. lt can slash or thrust, although the
inward curving point makes thrusting rath-
er ineffective. lts advantage is that a peasant
can easily convert his common scythe into
this weapon of war.
Fauchard-fork: This is an attempted
improvement on the fauchard, adding a
long spike or fork to the bad< of the blade.
Supposedly this improves the thrusting abil-
ity of the weapon. lt is still an inefficient
weapon.
Glaive: One of the most basic polearms,
the glaive is a single-edged blade mounted
on a eight- to ten-foot-long shaft. While not
the most efficient weapon, it is relatively
easy to make and use. Nomially the blade
tums outward to increase the cutting area
until it almost resembles a cleaver or axe.
Chive-guisarme: Another combination
weapon, this one takes the basic glaive and
adds a spike or hook to the back of the
blade. ln theory, this increases the useful-
ness of the weapon although its actual appli-
cation is somewhat questionable.
Guinrme: Thought to have derived from
a pnrning hook, this is an elaborately
curved heavy blade. While convenient and
handy, it is not very effective.
Guisarme-voulge: This weapon has a
modified axe blade mounted on an eight-
foot-long shaft. The end of the blade tapers
to a point for thrusting and a back spike is
fitted for punching through annor. Some-
times this spike is replaced by a sharpened
hook for dismounting riders.
Halberd: After the awl pike and the bill,
this was one of the most popular weapons of
74
the Middle Ages. Fixed on a shaft five to
eight feet long is a large axe blade, angled
for maximum impact. The end of the blade
tapers to a long spear point or awl pike. On
the back is a hook for attacking annor or
dismounting riders. Originally intended to
defeat cavalry, it is not tremendously suc-
cessful in that role since it lacks the reach of
the pike and needs considerable room to
swing. It found new life against blocks of
pikemen. Should the advance of the main
attack stall, haiberdiers issue out of the for-
mation and attack the ﬂanks of the enemy.
The pikemen with their overlong weapons
are nearly defenseless in such close combat.
Hook fanchard: This combination weap-
on is another attempted improvement to the
fauchard. A back hook is ﬁtted to the back
of the blade, supposedly to dismount horse-
men. Like the fauchard, this is not a tremen-
dously successful weapon.
Lucem hammer: This weapon is similar to
the bec de corbin. Fitted with a shaft up to
ten feet long, it is usually found in the hands
of the common soldier. Like the bec de cor-
bin, its main purpose is to punch through
armor. The end is fitted with the long point
of an awl pike to hold off enemy cavalry.
Military fork: This is one of the simplest
modifications of a peasants tool since it is
little more than a pitchfork fixed to a longer
shaft. With tines strengthened and straight-
ened, the military fork serves well. The need
for cutting and cleaving eventually often
results in combining the fork with other
weapons.
Partisan: Shorter than the awl pike but
longer than the spear, the partisan is a broad
spear-head mounted on an eight-foot-long
shaft. Two smaller blades project out from
the base of the main blade, just to increase
damage and trap weapons. Since it is a
thrusting weapon. it can be used in closely
packed formations.
Ranseun Very much like the partisan, the
ranseur differs in that the main blade is thin-
ner and the projecting blades extended more
like tines of a fork. These can trap a weapon
and sometimes punch through armor.
Spetum: The spetum is a modification of
the normal spear. The shaft increases to
eight to ten feet and side blades are added.
Some have blades that angle back, increas-
ing the damage when pulling the weapon
out of a wound. These blades can also trap
and block weapons or catch and hold an
opponent.
Voulge: The voulge, like the bardiche, is a
variation on the axe and the cleaver. The
voulge is little more than a deaver on the
end of a long (seven- to eight-foot) pole. lt is
a popular weapon, easy to make and simple
to learn. It is also called the Lochaber axe.
Scourge: This wicked weapon is a short
whip with several thongs or tails. Each
thong is studded with metal barbs, resulting



in a terrible lash. lt is sometimes used as an
instrument of execution.
Sword, Bastard: This sword is similar to a
long sword in size and weight, but has a
longer hilt. lt can be used one— or two-
handed. Use the speed factor and damage
appropriate to the grip. lf it is used two-
handed, your character cannot employ a
shield.
Sword, Khopesh: This is an Egyptian
weapon. A khopesh has about six inches of
handle and quillons. lts blade is then
straight from the quillons for about two
feet. The blade becomes sickle-shaped at
this point, being about two additional feet
long but effectively extending the overall
length of the sword by only 11/1 feet. This
makes the khopesh both heavy and
unwieldy, difficult to employ properly, and
slow to recover, particularly after a badly
missed blow. lts sickle-like portion can snag
an opponent or an opposing weapon.
Armor
You are going to
want your player character to buy annor, if
he is allowed to use any. Armor is the easiest
and cheapest way to improve your charac-
ter's chance of surviving the more violent
dangers of the adventuring life. Clearly, the
better the annor the character possesses, the
less likely he is to be hurt. Armor protection
is measured by Armor Class (AC), a number
rating: the lower the Armor Class number,
the better the protection. Table 46 lists the
values for all the types of armor found in the
equipment lists.

Note: See this page for more information

Although there is some controversy his-
torically over the different types of armor,
all known or suspected types are included
here. However, not all armor may be availa-
Equipment (Descriptions) I‘
ble if your DM has chosen to set his cam-
paign in a particular historical era or locale.
For example, full plate armor is not availa-
ble to characters adventuring in an ancient
Greek setting.
Banded: This armor is made of overlap-
ping strips of metal sewn to a backing of
leather and chain mail. Generally the strips
cover only the more vulnerable areas, while
the chain and leather protect the joints
where freedom of movement must be
ensured. Through straps and buckles, the
weight is more or less evenly distributed.
Brigandine: This armor is made from
small metal plates sewn or riveted to a layer
of canvas or leather and protected by an
outer layer of cloth. lt is rather stiff and does
not provide adequate protection to the
joints where the metal plates must be spaced
widely or left off.
Bronze plate mail: This is a plate mail
armor—a combination of metal plates,
chain mail or brigandine, leather and
padding—made of softer bronze. lt is easier
and cheaper to make than steel armor, but it
does not protect as well. A large breastplate
and other metal plates cover areas of the
body, but the other materials must protect
the joints and movable parts of the body. It
is not the full plate armor of the heavy
knight of the Late Middle Ages and the Ren-
aissance.
Chain mail: This armor is made of inter-
locking metal rings. lt is always wom with a
layer of quilted fabric padding undemeath
to prevent painful chafing and to cushion
the impact of blows. Several layers of mail
are normally hung over vital areas. The
links yield easily to blows. absorbing some
of the shock. Most of the weight of this
an-nor is carried on the shoulders and it is
uncomfortable to wear for long periods of
time.
Field plate armon This is the most com-
mon version of full plate armor, consisting
of shaped and fitted metal plates riveted and
interlocked to cover the entire body. lt
includes gauntlets, boots, and a visored hel-
met. A thick layer of padding must be worn
undemeath. However, the weight of the suit
is well-distributed over the whole body.
Such armor hampers movement only slight-
ly. Aside from its expense, the main disad-
vantages are the lack of ventilation and the
time required to put it on and take it off (see
the “Getting lnto and Out of Armor" sec-
tion). Each suit of field plate must be indi-
vidually fitted to its owner by a master
annorer, although captured pieces can be
resized to fit the new owner (unless such is
patently absurd, such as a human trying to
resize a halfling's armor).
Full Plate: This is the impressive, high
Gothic-style armor of the Late Middle Ages
and Renaissance. lt is perfectly forged and
fitted. All the plates are interlocking and
carefully angled to deﬂect blows. The sur-
75
faces are normally highly ornamented with
etching and inlaid metals. Each suit must be
carefully custom-fitted to the owner and
there is only a 20% chance that a captured
suit can be refitted to a new owner of
approximately the same size. The metal
plates are backed by padding and chain
mail. The weight is well-distributed. The
armor is hot, slow to don, and extremely
expensive. Due to these factors, it tends to
be used more for parades and triumphs than
actual combat.
Hide: This is armor prepared from the
extremely thick hide of a creature (such as
an elephant) or from multiple layers of regu-
lar leather. It is stiff and hard to move in.
Leather. This armor is made of leather
hardened in boiling oil and then shaped into
breastplate and shoulder protectors. The
remainder of the suit is fashioned from more
ﬂexible, somewhat softer materials.
Padded: This is the simplest type of
armor, fashioned from quilted layers of
cloth and batting. lt tends to get hot and
after a time becomes foul with sweat, grime.
lice. and fleas.
Plate mail: This armor is a combination
of chain or brigandine with metal plates
(curiass, epaulettes, elbow guards, gaunt-
lets, tassets, and greaves) covering vital
areas. The weight is distributed over the
whole body and the whole thing is held
together by buckles and straps. This is the
most common form of heavy annor.
Ring mail; This armor is an early (and less
effective) form of chain mail in which metal
rings are sewn directly to a leather backing
instead of being interlaced. (Historians still
debate whether this armor ever existed.)
Scale mail: This is a coat and leggings
(and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather
covered with overlapping pieces of metal,
much like the scales of a fish.
Shields: All shields improve a character's
Armor Class by 1 or more against a speci-
fied number of attacks. A shield is useful
only to protect the front and ﬂanks of the
user. Attacks from the rear or rear ﬂanks
cannot be blocked by a shield (exception: a
shield slung across the back does help
defend against rear attacks). The reference
to the size of the shield is relative to the size
of the character. Thus a human's small
shield would have all the effects of a medi-
um shield when used by a gnome.
A buckler (or target) is a very small shield
that fastens on the forearm. lt can be wom
by crossbowmen and archers with no hin-
drance. lts small size enables it to protect
against only one attack per melee round (of
the user's choice), improving the character's
Annor Class by 1 against that attack.
A small shield is carried on the forearm
and gripped with the hand. lts light weight
permits the user to carry other items in that
hand (although he cannot use weapons). It
can be used to protect against two frontal



“\-
attacks of the user's choice.
The medium shield is carried in the same
manner as the small shield. its weight pre-
vents the character from using his shield
hand for other purposes. With a medium
shield, a character can protect against any
frontal or ﬂank attacks.
The body shield is a massive shield reach-
ing nearly from chin to toe. It must be ﬁrmly
fastened to the forearm and the shield hand
must grip it at all times. lt provides a great
deal of protection, improving the Annor
Class of the character by 1 against melee
attacks and by 2 against missile attacks, for
attacks from the front or front ﬂank sides. it
is very heavy; the DM may wish to use the
optional encumbrance system if he allows
this shield.
Splint Mall: The existence of this armor
has been questioned. lt is claimed that the
armor is made of narrow vertical strips riv-
eted to a backing of leather and cloth pad-
ding. Since this is not ﬂexible, the joints are
protected by chain mail.
Studded leather: This annor is made
from leather (not hardened as with normal
leather armor) reinforced with close-set
metal rivets. ln some ways it is very similar
to brigandine, although the spacing
between each metal piece is greater.
ln addition to the types of annor listed
above, your DM may have special armors
prepared from rare or exotic materials.
Since it is highly imlikely that your charac-
ter can afford these at the start, the DM will
tell you when you need to know about such
items.
Armor Sizes
The equipment list reﬂects the price of a
suit of armor (including an appropriate hel-
met) made for any normal player character
race. Although a halfling is much smaller
than a human and needs a smaller suit. there
are fewer armorers available to meet such
specialized needs. Thus the armor for a half-
ling is as expensive as that for a human.
Armor for nonstandard sizes and shapes is
going to cost significantly more and must be
custom-made. This is not the kind of thing
one can pick up at the local store!
When armor is found during the course of
an adventure, the players should note the
creature who wore the armor previously.
While a human-sized character might be
able to wear the armor of a gnoll, it will do
little good for a halﬂing. Likewise, the
armor of a giant is of little use to anyone.
Armor size also affects the weight of the
amior, if the optional encumbrance system
is used. The weights listed on the table are
for human-sized (Medium) armors. Small
armor weighs half the amount listed, while
large armor weighs 50% more.
Getting Into and Out of Armor
There are times when it is important to
know how quickly a character can get into
or out of his armor. Accidents and unfore-
seen events happen all the time. The party is
attacked at night. Those sleeping around the
campfire may want to don their armor
before rushing into battle. A character slips
and falls into the river where his heavy
armor pulls him down like a stone. He
greatly desires to get it off before he drowns.
Iust how long does it take him?
The time required to don armor depends
on its make. Those armors that are a single
piece-leather tunics, robes. chain mail-—
take one round (two for metal items) to don
with slight assistance. Without aid, the time
is doubled. Armor that is made of separate
pieces requires 'ld6 + 4 rounds, again with
assistance. Without help, the time required
is tripled. In all cases, the times given
assume that the proper undergarments and
padding are also wom.
Sometimes characters need to get into
armor in a hurry and thus they dress hastily.
This assumes that some buckles aren't fas-
tened, seatings adjusted, etc. Single suits
can be hastily donned in one round at the
cost of 1 worse AC (though never worse
than 8). Thus, a ﬁghter could hastily pull on
his brigandine jack (AC 6) and charge into a
fray with an AC of 7. Hastily donning piece
armor (plate mail for example) improves the
character's AC by 1 (from a base of 10) for
every round spent dressing. A fighter could
choose to spend three rounds fitting on
parts of his plate mail, giving him an AC of
7, before going into battle.
Removing armor is a much quicker matter.
Most can be shed in a single round. Piece
armor (particularly full plate) requires 1d4 +
1 rounds. However, if the character is willing
to cut straps and bend pins, such armors can
be removed in half the time (roll 1d4 +1,
divide by 2, then round fractions up).
Creatures with Natural Armor Classes
Some creatures possess a natural Armor
Class already superior to some of the armor
WP“ (for example, the horse is AC 7).
However, these creatures can still benefit
from wearing armor of a quality worse than
their natural Armor Class. lf the AC of
an-nor is equal to or worse than the AC of
the creature, the AC of the creature
improves by 1.
For example, a horse has a natural AC of
7. The AC of leather armor is 8, worse than
the horse's natural AC. However, if a horse
is fitted with leather barding, its AC drops
to 6 since it gains the beneﬁt of the addition-
al protection.

of the 145 column shows that Tarus has a
modiﬁed movement rate of 7. He can
carry five more pounds of gear (total Z45
pounds) and maintain his speed, or drop
seven pounds of equipment (to 133
pounds) and increase his speed to 8.
incumbrance and Mounts
(Tournament Rule)
'l1\e “Base Move”
column in Table 49 lists the maximum
amount an animal can carry and main-
tain its normal movement rate. Animals
can be loaded greater than this, up to a
maximum of twice their normal load.
However, this cause a drop in tl\e ani-
mal's movement rate (as indicated by the
column headings). When calculating a
mount's load, be sure to include the
weight of the rider!
The values listed in Table 50 are tor
standard-sized items. It B certainly pos-
sible for sacks, chests, and backpacks to
be larger or smaller than the sizes listed.
The weight capacity, however, lists the
maximum weight the item can carry,
regardless of size. Beyond this point, the
material used to construct the item will
fail, sooner or later. The volume gives
the length, width, and height or depth of
the item. Items that exceed the capacity
ot a container cannot be stored in it.
Since all player characters are adven-
turers, it is assumed they know the best
methods for packing and stowing equip-
ment. Blankets are rolled into bedrolls,
small items are carefully arranged, rope
is properly coiled, weapons are slung in
the most comfortable manner. etc. While
small items can be easily stuffed into a
pack. large bulky things may encumber
more than their actual weight would
indicate. The DM has the right to rule
that an obiect is more encumber-ing than
it actually appears.
For example, Tums Bloodheart finds a
5’ X 9‘ ﬂying carpet. He carefully rolls it
into a thick cylinder and wisely ties it
closed. Even though he has taken this
sensible precaution, the carpet is still a
large and awkward thing. The DM rules
that although the carpet weighs only 20
pounds, it encumbrance |'s equal to that
of an item weighing 50 pounds. Tums
must increase his current encumbrance
level by 50 pounds, adding the awk-
wardness of the rolled carpet slung over
his shoulder to his already carefully
packed backpack.
Magical Annor and Encumbrance
One of the spe-
dal properties of magical armor is its
effect on encumbrance. Although magi-
cal armor appears to weigh as much as
normal armor, the weight of magical
armor applies only toward the weight
limit of the character. lt dos not apply
when determining the effects of encum-
brance on movement and combat. In
essence, the armor appears to weigh as
much as normal armor but does not
restrict or hamper the character.
For example, Cwell the bard finds a
suit of chain mail +1. Lifting it up, he
finds it weighs 60 pounds. Cwell is
already car-rying50 pounﬁ ofgear. Don-
ning the chain mail, he is now carrying
110 lbs. of gear. Cwell‘s Strength is 12.
which means that he can carry only 30
J’
more pounds of equipment. However,
when calculating the effect of all this
weight an his movement, Cwell is consid-
eraitoonlybecarry|'r|g50poia|dsof
gear—the magical armor doesn't count.
Furthermore, he does not suffer any com-
batpenalties for the chain mm'l's weight.
Etlects of Encumhrance
E n cu in b ra n c e
has two basic effects. First, it reduces
your character’: movement rate. If
encumbrance categories are used, Unen-
cumbered has no effect on movement,
Light reduces the movement rate by ‘ls
(round fractions down). Moderate
reduces it by 1/z, Heavy reduces it by 1/s,
and Severe lowers the movement rate to
1. If the optional system is used. the
character's movement rate is reduced to
the amount found by usingTable 48. The
movement rate determines how far your
character can move in a round, turn,
hour, and day. As his movement rate get:
lower, your character mova slower and
slower. See "Movement," on page 119,
for more details.
Encumbrance also reduces your char-
acter’s combat abilities. If encumbrance
reduces your character to 1/z of his nor-
mal movement rate, he suftersa -1 pen-
alty to his attack roll. it he is reduced to
‘ls or less of his normal movement rate,
theattackpenaltyis -Zandthereisan
additional AC penalty of +1. If your
character's movement is reduced to 1. the
attackrollpenaltyls -land theACpen-
altyis +3. Clearly, thewisethingfora
heavily encumbered character to do is to
quickly drop most of his gear before
entering battle.

hend, and so he must also live with a limit to
the number of spells he can know.
As the wizard leams spells, he records
their arcane notes into his spell books.
Without spell books, a wizard cannot mem-
orize new spells. Within them are all his
instructions for memorizing and casting all
the spells he knows. As the wizard success-
fully learns a new spell, he carefully enters
its formula into his spell books. A wizard
can never have a spell in his books that he
does not know, because if he doesn't ur\der-
stand it, he cannot write the formula. Like-
wise, he cannot enter a spell into his books
that is higher in level than he can cast. If he
finds an ancient tome with spells of higher
power, he must simply wait until he
advances to a level at which he can use
them.
The exact shape and size of a character's
spell books is a detail your DM will provide.
They may be thick tomes of carefully inked
parchment, crackling scrolls in bulky cases.
or even weighty clay tablets. They are
almost never convenient to carry around.
Their exact form depends on the type and
setting of the carnpaigi world your DM has
created.
Ultimately, it is the memorization that is
important. To draw on magical energy, the
wizard must shape specific mental patterns
in his mind. He uses his spell books to force
his mind through mental exercises, prepar-
ing it to hold the final, twisted pattems.
These pattems are very complicated and
alien to normal thought, so they don't regis-
ter in the mind as normal leaming. To shape
these pattems, the wizard must spend time
memorizing the spell, twisting his thoughts
and recasting the energy pattems each time
to account for subtle changes—planetary
motions, seasons, time of day, and more.
Once a wizard memorizes a spell, it
remains in his memory (as potential energy)
until he uses the prescribed components to
trigger the release of the energy patterns.
The mental patterns apparently release the
energy while the components shape and
guide it. Upon casting, the energy of the
spell is spent, wiped clean from the Wizard's
mind. The mental pattems are lost until the
wizard studies and memorizes that spell
again.
The number of spells a wizard can memo-
rize is given by his level (see Table 21); he
can memorize the same spell more than
once, but each memorization counts as one
spell toward his daily memorization limit.
Part of a wizard's intelligence can be seen in
the careful selection of spells he has memo-
rized.
Memorization is not a thing that happens
immediately. The wizard must have a clear
head gained from a restful night's sleep and
then has to spend time studying his spell
books. The amount of study time needed is
10 minutes per level of the spell being mem-
orized. Thus. a 9th-level spell (the most
powerful) would require 90 minutes of care-
ful study. Clearly, high-level spellcasters do
not lightly change their memorized spells.
Spells remain memorized until they are
cast or wiped from the character's mind by a
spell or magical item. A wizard cannot
choose to forget a memorized spell to
replace it with another one. He can. how-
ever, cast a spell just to cleanse his mind for
another spell. (The DM must make sure that
the wizard does not get experience for this.)
Schools oi Magic
Although all wiz-
ard spells are leamed and memorized the
same way, they fall into nine different
schools of magic. A school of magic is a
group of related spells.
Abjumtion spells are a group of special-
ized protective spells. Each is used to pre-
vent or banish some magical or nonmagical
effect or creature. They are often used to
provide safety in times of great danger or
when attempting some other particularly
dangerous spell.
Alteration spells cause a change in the
properties of some already existing thing.
creature, or condition. This is accomplished
by magical energy channeled through the
wizard.
Coniumtion/summoning spells bring
something to the caster from elsewhere.
Conjuration normally produces matter or
items from some other place. Summoning
enables the caster to compel living creatures
and powers to appear in his presence or to
channel extraplanar energies through him-
self.
Enchantment/charm spells cause a
change in the quality of an item or the atti-
tude of a person or creature. Enchantments
can bestow magical properties on ordinary
items, while charms can unduly influence
the behavior of beings.
Greater diuinations are more powerful
than lesser divinations (see below). These
spells enable the wizard to leam secrets long
forgotten, to predict the future, and to
uncover things hidden or cloaked by spells.
Illusions deal with spells to deceive the
senses or minds of others. Spells that cause
people to see things that are not there, hear
noises not made, or remember things that
never happened are all illusions.
Invocation/Evocntion spells channel
magical energy to create specific effects and
materials. Invocation normally relies on the
intervention of some higher agency (to
whom the spell is addressed), while evoca-
tion enables the caster to directly shape the
energy.
Lesser divination spells are learnable by
all wizards. regardless of their affiliation.
This school includes the most basic and vital
spells of the wizard—those he needs to prac-
tice other aspects of his craft. Lesser divina-
tions include read magic and detect magic.
Necromancy is one of the most restrictive
of all spell schools. lt deals with dead things
or the restoration of life, limbs, or vitality to
living creatures. Although a small school,
its spells tend to be powerful. Given the
risks of the adventuring world. necromantic
spells are considered quite useful.
Learning Spells
Whether a charac-
ter chooses to be a mage or a specialist in
one of the schools of magic. he must leam
his spells from somewhere. While it might
be possible for the exceptional wizard to
leam the secrets of arcane lore entirely on
his own, it isn't very likely. lt is far more
likely that your character was apprenticed
to another wizard as a lad. This kindly
(severe), loving (callous). understanding
(ill-tempered), generous (mean-spirited),
and upright (untrustworthy) master taught
your character everything he knows at the
start of the game. Then, when it was time,
the master sent him into the world (threw
him out) with a smile and a pat on the back
(snarling with his foot on your character's
behind).
Or perhaps your character studied at a
proper academy for wizards (it your DM
has such things). There he completed his les-
sons under the eye of a firm (mean) but
patient (irritable) tutor who was ready with
praise for good work (a cane for the slightest
fault). But alas. your character's parents
were impoverished and his studies had to
end (fed up with this treatment, your youth-
ful character fled during the night).
As you can see, there are a number of
ways your character might have learned his
spells.
The one good thing that comes from your
character's studies is his initial spell book. It
may have been a gift from his school or he
may have stolen it from his hated master.
Whatever the case. your character begins
play with a spell book containing up to a
few 1st-level spells. Your DM will tell you
the exact number of spells and which spells
they are. As your character adventures, he
will have the opportunity to add more spells
to his collection.
When your character attains a new level,
he may or may not reoeive new spells. This
is up to your DM. He may allow your char-
acter to return to his mentor (provided he
departed on good termsl) and add a few
spells to his book. lt may be possible for
your character to copy spells from the spell
book of another player character (with his
permission, of course). Or he may have to
wait until he can find a spell book with new
spells. How he gets his spells is one of the
things your DM decides.
ln all cases, before he can add a new spell



tohisspellbook,youhavetochecktoseeif
your character leams that spell. The chance
of leaming a spell depends on your wiz.ard's
Intelligence, as given in Table 4. This chance
may be raised or lowered if your character is
a specialist.
Illusions
Of all spells, those
of the illusion school cause the most prob-
lerns. Not that they are more difficult for
your player character to cast, but these
spells are more difficult for you to role—play
and for your DM to adjudicate. Illusions
rely on the idea of believabillty, which in
turn relies on the situation and the state of
mind of the victim. Your DM must deter-
mine this for NPCS, which is perhaps an eas-
ier iob. You must role-play this for your
character.
Spells of this school fall into two basic
groups. Illusions are creations that manipu-
late light. color, shadow, sound, and some-
times even scent. Higher level illusions tap
energy from other planes, and are actually
quasi-real, being woven of extradimen-
sional energies by the caster. Common illu-
sions create appearances; they cannot make
a creature or object look like nothing (i.e.,
invisible), but they can conceal objects by
making them look like something else.
Phantasrns exist only in the minds of their
victims; these spells are never even quasi-
real. (The exceptions to this are the phantas-
rnal force spells, which are actually illusions
rather than phantasms.) Phantasms act
upon the mind of the victim to create an
intense reaction—fear being most common.
The key to successful illusions or phan-
tasms is believability, which depends on
three main factors: what the caster
attempts, what the victim expects, and what
is happening at the moment the spell is cast.
By combining the information from these
three areas, the player and the DM should
be able to create and adjudicate reasonable
illusions and phantasms.
When casting an illusion or phantasm,
the caster can attempt to do anything he
desires within the physical limits of the
spell. Prior knowledge of the illusion cre-
ated is not necessary but is extremely useful.
For example, suppose Delsenora decides to
cast a phantasmal force spell and can choose
between creating the image of a troll (a crea-
ture she has seen and battled) or that of a
beholder (a creature she his never seen but
has heard terrifying dmcriptions of). She can
either use her memory to create a realistic
troll or use her imagination to create same-
thing that may or may not look like a real
beholder. The troll, based on her ﬁrst-hand
knowledge of these creatures, is going to
have lots of little detaiLs—a big nose, warts,
green, scabby skin, and even a shambling
troll-like walk. Her illusion of a beholder will
be much less precise, iust a floating ball with
one big eye and eyestalks. 5he doesn't know
its color, size, or behavior.
The type of image chosen by the caster
affects the reaction of the victim. If the vic-
tim in the above case has seen both a troll
and a beholder, which will be more believ-
able‘! Almost certainly it will be the troll,
whidi looks and acts the way the victim
thinks a troll should. He might not even rec-
ognize the other creature as a beholder since
it doesn't look like any beholder he's ever
seen. Even if the victim has never seen a troll
or a beholder, the troll will still be more
believable; it acts in a realistic manner,
82
while the beholder does not. Thus spellcast-
ers are well-advised to create images of
things they have seen, for the same reason
authors are advised to write about things
they know.
The next important consideration is to
ask if the spell creams something that the
victim expects. Which of these two illusions
would be more believable—a huge dragon
rising up behind a rank of attacking kobolds
(puny little creatures) or a few ogres form-
ing a line behind the koboldsl Most adven-
turers would find it hard to believe that a
dragon would be working with kobolds.
The dragon is far too powerful to associate
with such little shrimps. Ogres, however,
could very well work with kobolds—
bossing them around and using them as can-
non fodder. The key to a good illusion is to
create something the victim does not expect
but can quickly accept.
The most believable illusion may be that
of a solid wall in a dungeon, transforming a
passage into a dead md. Unless the victim is
familiar with these hallways, he has no rea-
son not to believe that the wall is there.
Of course, in a fantasy world many more
things can be believed than in the real
world. Flames do not spring out of nowhere
in the real world, but this can happen in a
fantasy world. The presence of magic in a
fantasy world makes victims more willing
to accept things our logic tells us cannot
happen. A creature appearing out of
nowhere could be an illusion or it could be
summoned. At the same time, you must
remember that a properly role-played char-
acter is familiar with the laws of his world.
If a wall of ﬂames appears out of nowhere.
he will look for the spellcaster. A wall
blocking a corridor may cause him to dteck
for secret doors. lf the illusion doesn't con-
form to his idea of how things work, the
character should become suspicious. This is
something you have to provide for your
character and something you must remem-
ber when your character attempts to use
illusions.
This then leads to the third factor in the
believability of an illusion, how appropriate
the illusion is for the situation. As men-
tioned before. the victim is going to have
certain expectations about any given
encounter. The best illusions reinforce these
expectations to your character's advantage.
lmagine that your group runs into a war
party of orcs in the local forest. What could
you do that would reinforce what the ores
might already believe? They see your
group, armed and ready for battle. They do
not know if you are alone or are the advance
guard for a bigger troop. A good illusion
could be the glint of metal and spear points
coming up behind your party. Subtlety has
its uses. The ores will likely interpret your
illusion as reinforcements to your youp,
enough to discourage them from attacking.

Magic (Priest Spells)
However, the limitations of each spell
must be considered when iudging appropri-
ateness. A phantasmal force spell creates
vision only. It does not provide sound, light.
or heat. ln the preceding situation, creating
a troop of soldiers galloping up behind you
would not have been believable. Where is
the thunder of hooves, the creak of saddle
leather, the shouts of your allies, the clank
of drawn metal, or the whinny of horses?
Orcs may not be tremendously bright. but
they are not fooled that easily. Likewise, a
dragon that suddenly appears without a
thunderous roar and dragonish stench isn't
likely to be accepted as real. A wise spell-
caster always considers the limitations of his
illusions and finds ways to hide their weak-
nesses from the enemy.
An illusion spell, therefore, depends on
its believability. Believability is determined
by the situation and a saving throw. Under
normal circumstances, those observing the
illusion are allowed a saving throw vs. spell
if they actively disbelieve the illusion. For
player characters, disbelieving is an action
in itself and takes a round. For NPCs and
monsters, a normal saving throw is made if
the DM deems it appropriate. The DM can
give bonuses or penalties to this saving
throw as he thinks appropriate. If the caster
has cleverly prepared a realistic illusion, this
certainly results in penalties on the victim's
saving throw. lf the victim were to rely
more on scent than sight, on the other hand,
it could gain bonuses to its saving throw. If
the saving throw is passed, the victim sees
the illusion for what it is. If the saving throw
is failed, the victim believes the illusion. A
good indication of when player characters
should receive a positive modifier to their
saving throws is When they say they don't
believe what they see, especially if they can
give reasons why.
There are rare instances when the saving
throw may automatically succeed or fail.
There are times when the illusion created is
either so perfect or so utterly fantastic as to
be impossible even in a fantasy world, Be
wamed, these 0CCasionS are very rare and
you should not expect your characters to
benefit from them more than once or twice.
In many encounters, some party mem-
bers will believe an illusion while others see
it for what it really is. ln these cases. reveal-
ing the truth to those deluded by the spell is
not a simple matter of telling them. The
magic of the spell has seized their minds.
Considered from their point of view, they
see a horrible monster (or whatever) while a
friend is telling them it isn't real. They know
magic can affect people's minds, but whose
mind has been affected in this case? At best,
having an illusion pointed out grants
another saving throw with a +4 bonus.
illusions do have other limitations. The
caster must maintain a show of reality at all
times when conducting an illusion. (lf a
squad of low-level fighters is created. the
caster dictates their hits, misses. damage
inﬂicted, apparent wounds, and so forth,
and the referee decides whether the bounds
of believability have been exceeded.) Main-
taining an illusion normally requires con-
centration on the part of the caster,
preventing him from doing other things.
Disturb him and the illusion vanishes.
Illusions are spells of trickery and deceit,
not damage and destruction. Thus, illusions
cannot be used to cause real damage. When
a creature is caught in the blast of an illu-
sionary fireball or struck by the claws of an
illusionary troll, he thinks he takes damage.
The DM should record the illusionary dam-
age (but tell the player his character has tak-
en real damage). If the character takes
enough damage to "die," he collapses in a
faint. A system shock roll should be made
for the character. (His mind, believing the
damage to be real, may cause his body to
cease functioning!) lf the character survives,
he regains consciousness after 1d3 tums
with his illusionary damage healed. ln most
cases, the character quickly realizes that it
was all an illusion.
When an illusion creates a situation of
inescapable death, such as a giant block
dropping from the ceiling, all those believ-
ing the illusion must roll for system shock. If
they fail, they die—killed by the sheer terror
of the situation. lf they pass, they are
allowed a new saving throw with a +4
bonus. Those who pass recognize the illu-
sion for what it is. Those who fail faint for
1d3 tums.
Illusions do not enable characters to defy
normal physical laws. A illusionary bridge
cannot support a character who steps on it,
even if he believes the bridge is real. A illu-
sionary wall does not actually cause a rock
thrown at it to bounce off. However, affect-
ed creatures attempt to simulate the reality
of what they see as much as possible. A
character who falls into an illusionary pit
drops to the ground as if he had fallen. A
character may lean against an illusionary
wall, not realizing that he isn't actually put-
ting his weight on it. lf the same character
were suddenly pushed, he would find him-
self falling through the very wall he thought
was solidi
Illusions of creatures do not automati-
cally behave like those creatures, nor do
they have those creatures’ powers. This
depends on the casters ability and the vic-
tim's knowledge of the creatures. Illusion-
ary creatures fight using the caster's combat
ability. They take damage and die when
their caster dictates it. An illusory orc could
continue to fight, showing no damage, even
after it had been struck a hundred or a thou-
sand times. Of course, long before this its
attackers will become suspicious. Illusion-
ary creatures can have whatever special
abilities the caster can make appear (i.e., a
84
dragon’s fiery breath or a tro|l's regenera-
tion), but they do not necessarily have
unseen special abilities. There is no way a
caster can create the illusion of a basilisk's
gaze that tums people to stone. However.
these abilities might be manifested through
the fears of the victims. For example, Rath
the fighter meets an illusionary basilisk.
Rath has fought these beasties before and
knows what they can do. His gaze acciden-
tally locks with that of the basilisk. Primed
by his own fears, Rath must make a system
shock roll to remain alive. But if Rath had
never seen a basilisk and had no idea that
the creature's gaze could tum him to stone,
there is no way his mind could generate the
fear necessary to kill him. Sometimes igno-
rance is blissl
Priest Spells
The spells of a
priest, while sometimes having powers simi-
lar to those of the wizard, are quite different
in their overall tone. The priest's role, more
often than not, is as defender and guide for
others. Thus the majority of his spells work
to aid others or provide some service to the
community in which he lives. Few of his
spells are truly offensive, but many can be
used cleverly to protect or defend.
Like the wizard, the priest's level deter-
mines how many spells he retains. He must
select these spells in advance, demonstrat-
ing his wisdom and far-sightedness by
choosing those spells he thinks will be most
useful in the trials that lurk ahead.
Unlike the wizard, the priest needs no
spell book and does not roll to see if he
learns spells. Priest spells are obtained in an
entirely different manner. To obtain his
spells, a priest must be faithful to the cause
of his deity. if the priest feels confident in
this (and most do). he can pray for his
spells. Through prayer, the priest humbly
and politely requests those spells he wishes
to memorize. Under normal circumstances.
these spells are then granted.
A priest's spell selection is limited by his
level and by the different spheres of spells.
(The spheres of inﬂuence, into which priest
spells are divided, can be found on page 34.)
Within the major spheres of his deity, a
priest can use any spell of a given level when
he is able to cast spells of that level. Thus, a
druid is able to cast any 2nd-level plant
sphere spells when he is able to cast 2nd-
level spells. For spells belonging to the
minor spheres of the priest's deity, he can
cast spells only up to 3rd level. The knowl-
edge of what spells are available to the priest
becomes instantly clear as soon as he
advances in level. This, too, is bestowed by
his deity.
Priests must pray to obtain spells, as they
are requesting their abilities from some
greater power, be it their deity or some



intermediary agent of this power. The con-
ditions for praying are identical to those
needed for the wizards studying. Clearly
then, it behooves the priest to maintain him-
self in good standing with this power.
through word and deed. Priests who slip in
their duties, harbor indiscreet thoughts, or
neglect their beliefs, find that their deity has
an immediate method of redress. lf the
priest has failed in his duties, the deity can
deny him spells as a clear message of dissat-
isfaction. For minor infractions, the deity
can deny minor spells. Major failings result
in the denial of major spells or, even worse.
all spells. These can be regained if the char-
acter immediately begins to make amends
for his errors. Perhaps the character only
needs to be a little more vigilant, in the case
of a minor fault. A serious transgression
could require special service, such as a quest
or some great sacrifice of goods. These are
things your DM will decide, should your
character veer from the straight and narrow
path of his religion.
Finally, your DM may rule that not all
deities are equal, so that those of lesser
power are unable to grant certain spells. lf
this optional rule is used, powers of demi-
god status can only grant spells up to the Sth
spell level. Lesser deities can grant 6th-level
spells, while the greater deities have all spell
levels available to them. You should inquire
about this at the time you create your char-
acter (and decide which deity he worships),
to prevent any unwelcome surprises later
OH.
Casting Spells
Both wizards and
priests use the same rules for casting spells.
To cast a spell, the character must first have
the spell memorized. lf it is not memorized,
the spell cannot be cast. The caster must be
able to speak (not under the effects of a
silence spell or gagged) and have both arms
free. (Note that the optional spell compo-
nent rule [following section] can modify
these conditions.) lf the spell is targeted on a
person. place, or thing, the caster must be
able to see the target. lt is not enough to cast
a fireball 150 feet ahead into the darkness;
the caster must be able to see the point of
explosion and the intervening distance.
Likewise, a magic missile (which always hits
its target) cannot be fired into a group of
bandits with the instruction to strike the
leader; the caster must be able to identify
and see the leader.
Once the casting has begun, the character
must stand still. Casting cannot be accom-
plished while riding a roughly moving beast
or a vehicle, unless special efforts are made
to stabilize and protect the caster. Thus a
spell cannot be cast from the back of a gal-
loping horse under any conditions, nor can
a wizard or priest cast a spell on the deck of
4
l
a ship during a storm. However, if the caster
were below decks, protected from the wind
and surging waves, he could cast a spell.
While it is not normally possible to cast a
spell from a moving chariot, a character
who was steadied and supported by others
could do so. Your DM will have to make a
ruling in these types of extraordinary condi-
tions.
During the round in which the spell is
cast, the caster cannot move to dodge
attacks. Therefore. no AC benefit from
Dexterity is gained by spellcasters while
casting spells. Furthermore, if the spellcast-
er is struck by a weapon or fails to make a
saving throw before the spell is cast, the
casters concentration is disrupted. The spell
is lost in a fizzle of useless energy and is
wiped clean from the memory of the caster
until it can be rememorized. Spellcasters are
well advised not to stand at the front of any
battle, at least if they want to be able to cast
any spells!

Spell Components
(Optional Rule)
When your char-
acter casts a spell, it is assumed that he is
doing something to activate that spell.
He may utter a few words, wave his
hand around a couple of times, wiggle
his toes, swallow a live spider, etc. But,
under the standard rules, you don't have
to know exactly what he does to activate
the spell. Some of this can be answered if
your DM uses the rules for spell compo-
nents.
The actions required to cast a spell are
divided into three groups; verbal,
somatic (gestures), and material. Fach
spell description (starting on page 131)
lists what combination of these compo-
nents is needed to cast a spell. Verbal
components require the caster to speak
clearly (not be silenced in any way);



Magic (Magical Research)
somatic components require free gs-
tures (thus the caster cannot be bound or
held); material components must be
tossed,  burned, eaten, broken,
or whatever for the spell to work. While
there is no specific desciption of the
wordlandgesturesthatmustbepeﬁ
formed, the material components are
listed in the spell descriptions. Some of
these are common and easy to obtain.
Others represent items of great value or
scarcity. Whatever the component. it is
automatically destroyed or lost when the
spell is cast, unless the spell description
spedfically notes otherwise.
lf the spell components optional rule is
used in your campaign, your wizard or
priest must have these items to cast the
spell. Without them, he is helpless, even
if the spell is memorized. For simplicity
ofplay, itisbesttoassume that anyspell-
caster with any sense has a supply of the
common iternshe lslikely to need—wax,
feathers, paint, sand, sticks. and fluff,
for example. For expensive and rare
items, it ls perfectly proper for your DM
to insist that spedal efforts be made to
obtain these items. After all. you simply
mnnot assume your character has a
valuable pearl handy whenever he needs
onel
The three different aspects of spell
components also change the conditions
under which your character can cast his
spells. No longer does he need to be able
to speak, move, and use some item. He
only needs to fulfill the required compo-
nents. Thus a spell with only a verbal
component could be used by a naked,
bound r-pellcaster. One requiring only
gestures could be cast even within the
radius of a silence spell. Most spells
require a combination of components,
but clever spellcasters often create new
spells that need only a Word or a gesture,
enabling them to take their enemies by
surprise.
Magical Research
Qne oft~ignored as-
set of both wizards and priests is magical
research. While the spell lists for both
groups offer a wide variety of tools and
effects, the clever player character can
quickly get an edge by researching his own
spells. Where other spellcasters may fall
quickly into tired and predictable pattems
("Look, it's a mage! Get ready for the fire-
ball, guysl"), an enterprising character can
deliver sudden (and nasty) surprises!
Although your DM has the rules for han-
dling spell research, there are some things
you should know about how to proceed.
First and foremost, research means that you
and your DM will be working together to
expand the game. This is not a job he does
for you! Without your input. nothing hap-
pens. Second, whatever your character
researches, it cannot be more powerful than
the spells he is already able to cast. If it is,
you must wait until your character can cast
spells of an equal power. (Thus as a Ist-
level wizard, you cannot research a spell
that is as powerful as a fireball. You must
wait until your character can cast a ﬁreball.)
Finally, you will have to be patient and will-
ing to have your character spend some
money. He won't create the spell immedi-
ately, as research takes time. It also takes
money, so you can expect your DM to use
this opportunity to relieve your character of
some of that excess cash. But, after all, how
better for a spellcaster to spend his money?
Knowing these things, you should first
write up a description of the spell you want
to create. Be sure to include information on
components, saving throws, range, dura-
tion, and all the other entries you find in the
normal spell listings. When you give your
DM the written description, tell him what
you want the spell to do. (Sometimes what
you write isn't really what you mean, and
talking to your DM is a good way to prevent
confusion.) After this, he will either accept
or reject your spell. This is his choice and
not all DMs will have the same answer.
Don't kick and complain; find out what
changes are needed to make the spell accept-
able. You can probably iron out the differ-
QYICBS.
Once all these things are done, your char-
acter can research the spell. Be ready for this
to take some time. Eventually he will suc-
ceed, although the spell may not do quite
what he expected. Your DM may revise the
spell, perhaps reducing the area of effect or
damage inﬂicted. Finally, all you have to do
is name your spell. This should be some-
thing suitably pompous, such as "Del-
senora's Malevolent Steamroller." After all.
you want something to impress the locals!
Spell Descriptions
The spells are orga-
nized according to their group (priest or
wizard) and level, starting on page 131.
Within each level, the spells are arranged
alphabetically. At the start of each spell
description is the following important game
information:
Name: Each spell is identified by name, in
parentheses after the name is the school (for
wizard spells) to which that spell belongs.
When more than one is listed, that spell is
common to all schools given.
Some spells are reversible (they can be
cast for an effect opposite to that of the
standard spell). This is noted after the spell
name. Priests with reversible spells must
memorize the desired version. For example,
86
a priest who desires a cause light wounds
spell must petition for this form of the cure
light wounds spell when meditating and
praying. Note that severe penalties can
result if the spell choice is at variance with
the priest's alignment (possible penalties
include denial of specific spells, entire spell
levels, or even all spells for a certain peri-
od). The exact result (if any) depends on the
reaction of the priest's patron deity, as deter-
mined by the DM.
Reversible wizard spells operate similarly.
When the spell is leamed, both forms are
recorded in the wizards spell books. How-
ever, the wizard must decide which version
of the spell he desires to cast when memoriz-
ing the spell, unless the spell description spe-
cifically states otherwise. For example, a
wizard who has memorized stone to flesh
and desires to cast ﬂesh to stone must wait
until the latter form of the spell can be mem-
orized (i.e., rest eight hours and study). lf he
could memorize two 6th-level spells, he
could memorize each version once or one
version twice.
School: ln parentheses after the spell
name is the name of the school of magic to
which the spell belongs. For wizard spells,
this defines which spells a wizard specialist
can learn, depending on the wizards school
of specialization, For priest spells. the
school notation is used only for reference
purposes, to indicate which school the spell
is considered to belong to. in case the DM
needs to know for spell resistance (e.g.,
elves’ resistance to charm spells).
Sphere: This entry appears only for priest
spells and identifies the sphere or spheres
into which that spell falls.
Range: This lists the distance from the
caster at which the spell effect occurs or
begins. A "0" indicates the spell can be used
on the caster only, with the effect embodied
within or emanating from him. "Touch"
means the caster can use the spell on others
if he can physically touch them. Unless oth-
erwise specified, all other spells are centered
on a point visible to the caster and within
the range of the spell. The point can be a
creature or object if desired. In general, a
spell that affects a limited number of crea-
tures within an area affects those closest to
the center of the area first, unless there are
other parameters operating (such as level or
Hit Dice). Spells can be cast through narrow
openings only if both the casters vision and
the spell energy can be directed simultane-
ously through the opening. A wizard stand-
ing behind an arrow slit can cast through it;
sending a fireball through a small peephole
he is peering through is another matter.
Components: This lists the category of
components needed, V for verbal. S for
somatic, and M for material. When material
components are required, these are listed in
the spell description. Spell components are
expended as the spell is cast. unless other-



wise noted. Clerical holy symbols are not
lost when a spell is cast. For cases in which
material components are expended at the
end of the spell (free action, shapechange,
etc.), premature destruction of the compo-
nents ends the spell.
Duration: This lists how long the magical
energy of the spell lasts. Spells of instanta-
neous duration come and go the moment
they are cast, although the results of these
spells may be permanent and unchangeable
by normal means. Spells of permanent
duration last until the effects are negated by
some means, usually by a dispel magic.
Some spells have a variable duration. ln
most cases, the caster cannot choose the
duration of spells. Spells with set durations
(e.g., 3 rounds/level] must be kept track of
by the player. Spells of variable duration
(e.g., 3 '4“ 1d4 rounds) are secretly rolled
and recorded by the DM. Your DM may
warn you when spell durations are
approaching expiration. but there is usually
no sign that a spell is going to expire; check
with your DM to determine exactly how he
handles this issue.
Certain spells can be ended at will by the
caster. ln order to dismiss these spells. the
original caster must be within range of the
spell's center of effect—within the same
range at which the spell can be cast. The
caster also must be able to speak words of
dismissal. Note that only the original caster
can dismiss his spells in this way.
Casting Time: This entry is important, if
the optional casting time rules are used. lf
only a number is given, the casting time is
added to the caster's initiative die rolls. if
the spell requires a round or number of
rounds to cast, it goes into effect at the end
of the last round of casting time. If
Delsenora casts a spell that takes one round.
it goes into effect at the end of the round in
which she begins casting. lf the spell
requires three rounds to cast, it goes into
effect at the end of the third round. Spells
requiring a tum or more go into effect at the
end of the stated turn.
Area of Effect: This lists the creatures,
volume, dimensions, weight, etc., that can
be affected by the spell. Spells with an area
or volume that can be shaped by the caster
will have a minimum dimension of 10 feet in
any direction, unless the spell description
specifically states otherwise. Thus a cloud
that has a 10-foot cube per caster level
might, when cast by a 12th-level caster,
have dimensions 10' X 10' X 120’, Z0’ X
20' X 30‘, or any similar combination that
totals twelve 10-foot cubes. Combinations
such as 5' X 10’ X Z40’ are not possible
unless specifically allowed.
Some spells (such as bless) affect the
friends or enemies of the caster. ln all cases,
this refers to the perception of the caster at
the time the spell is cast. For example, a cha-
otic good character allied with a lawful neu-
Magic (Spell l
tral cleric would receive the benefits of the
latter's bless spell.
Saving Throw: This lists whether the spell
allows the target a saving throw and the
effect of a successful save: "Neg." results in
the spell having no effect; "1/2" means the
character suffers half the normal amount of
damage: "none" means no saving throw is
allowed.
Wisdom adjustments to saving throws
apply to enchantment/charm spells.
Solid physical barriers provide saving
throw bonuses and damage reduction. Cov-
er and concealment may affect saving
throws and damage (the DM has additional
information about this).
A creature that successfully saves against
a spell with no apparent physical effect
(such as a charm. hold, or magic jar) may
feel a definite force or tingle that is charac-
teristic of a magical attack, if the DM
desires. But the exact hostile spell effect or
creature ability used cannot be deduced
from this tingle.
A beings carried equipment and posses-
sions are assumed to make their saving
throws against special attacks if the creature
makes its saving throw, unless the spell spe-
cifically states othenuise. If the creature fails
its saving throw, or if the attack form is par-
ticularly potent, the possessions may
require saving throws using either item sav-
ing throws (see the DMG) or the beings sav-
ing throw. The DM will inform you when
this happens.
Any character can voluntarily forgo a
saving throw. This allows a spell or similar
attack that normally grants a saving throw
to have full effect on the character. Like-
wise, any creature can voluntarily lower its
magic resistance allowing a spell to auto-
matically function when cast on it. Forgoing
a saving throw or magic resistance roll need
not always be voluntary. lf a creature or
character can be tricked into lowering its
resistance, the spell will have full effect.
even if it is not the spell the victim believed
he was going to receive. The victim must
consciously choose to lower his resistance:
it is not sufficient that he is caught off guard.
For example, a character would receive a
saving throw if a mage in the party suddenly
attacked him with a fireball. even if the
mage had been friendly to that point. How-
ever, the same character would not receive a
saving throw if the mage convinced him
that he was about to receive a levitntion
spell but cast a ﬁreball instead. Your DM
will decide when NPCs have lowered their
resistances. You must tell your DM when
your character is voluntarily lowering his
resistance.
Spell Description: The text provides a
complete description of how the spell func-
tions and its game effects. lt covers most
typical uses of the spell, if there are more
than one, but cannot deal with every possi-
ble application players might find. in these
cases, the spell information in the text
should provide guidance on how to adjudi-
cate the situation.
Spells with multiple functions enable the
caster to select which function he wants to
use at the time of casting. Usually a single
function of a multiple-function spell is
weaker than a single-function spell of the
same level.
Spell effects that give bonuses or penalties
to abilities, attack rolls. damage rolls, sav-
ing throws, etc., are not usually cumulative
with each other or with other magic: the
strongest single effect applies. For example,
a fighter drinks a potion of giant strength
and then receives the Znd-level wizard spell
strength. Only the strongest magic (the
potion) is effective. When the potion's dura-
tion ends, however, the strength spell is still
in effect, until its duration also expires.

‘ Chapter 8: Experience
After a player's character has bravely set
out and survived his first adventure. the
player will have experienced the entertain-
ment of role-playing games. But what will
the character have gained? lf the character
never improves, he will never be able to sur-
vive, let alone overcome the powerful dan-
gers that fill the AD&D" game worlds.
Fortunately, this isn't the case. Every time
a character goes on an adventure he learns
something. He may leam a little more about
his physical limits, encounter a creature he
has never seen before, try a spell as yet
unused, or discover a new peculiarity of
nature. indeed, not all his learning experi-
ence need be positive. After blowing up half
his party with a poorly placed fireball, a
wizard may (though there is no guarantee)
learn to pay more attention to ranges and
areas of effect. After charging a basilisk, a
fighter may learn that caution is a better tac-
tic for dealing with the beast (provided the
other characters can change him from stone
back to flesh). Regardless of the method, the
character has managed to learn something.
Some of the information and skills
leamed in the game can be applied directly
in play. When a wizard toasts his friends
with a badly cast fireball, the player leams
to pay more attention to the area of effect of
a fireball. Though the player made the mis-
take and his character only carried out the
actions, the player's friends will also leam to
keep their characters well away from his.
The reward for this type of learning is
direct and immediate. The characters bene-
fit because each of the players has a better
understanding of what to do or where to go.
However, a character also improves by
increasing his power. Although the player
can improve his play, he cannot arbitrarily
give his character more hit points, more
spells, or a better chance to hit with an
attack. These gains are made by earning
experience points (XP).
An experience point is a concrete measure
of a character's improvement. lt represents a
host of abstract factors: increased confi-
dence, physical exerdse, insight, and on-
the—job training. When a character earns
enough experience points to advance to the
next experience level. these abstract factors
translate into a measurable improvement in
the abilities of the character. Just what areas
improve and how quickly improvement
occurs all depend on the character's clas.
Group Experience Awards
Experience points
are eamed through the activities of the char-
acters, which generally relate to their
adventuring goals. Thus all characters on an
adventure receive some experience points
for overcoming their enemies or obstacles.
Since group cooperation is important, expe-
rience points for defeating foes are given to
all members of the group. regardless of their
actions. Who is to say that the wizard,
standing ready with a spell just in case
things got ugly, might not have been neces-
sary? Or that the bard who covered the par-
ty's escape route wasn't doing something
important’! A character who never hefts a
sword may still have good advice or impor-
tant suggestions on better tactics. Further-
more, the wizard and the bard can also learn
from the actions of others.
Individual
Experience Awards
Player characters
also earn experience points for individual
deeds, as determined by their class. Gener-
ally, each character eams points for doing
actions appropriate to his group. Warriors
eam additional experience points for defeat-
ing creatures. The more difficult the battle,
the greater the number of experience points.
Wizards eam points for using their spells for
specific purposes. The wizard who walks
into the woods and casts his spells for no
reason doesn't gain experience points; the
wizard who casts a lightning bolt at a
beholder has used his spell for a purpose. He
gains experience points. Wizards also eam
experience points for researching new spells
and creating magical items. Priests can eam
experience points by spreading their beliefs
and using their powers in service of their
deity. Rogues, who tend to have a larcenous
streak, eam experience points by using their
special abilities and finding or eaming gold.
A character can also earn experience for
the player's actions, such as playing the
game well. When a player does a good job
creating and pretending to be his character,
the DM may give the character experience
points for good role-playing. If the player is
really involved and takes a major part in the
game, the DM can give the player's charac-
ter extra experience points. If the player uses
his head to come up with a really good idea,
the DM can give the character experience
points for his contribution.
Finally, a character can earn experience
points for successfully completing an
adventure or achieving a goal the DM has
set. Although a player may have a pretty
good idea of what his character is supposed
to accomplish, he won't lcnow if he'll be
awarded experience points for it until his
character actually receives them. However,
there is no rule that the DM must be consist-
ent in these awards, or even that he must
give a character anything at all.
Training
Even when a char-
acter has eamed enough experience to attain
the next level, the DM may not allow imme-
diate advancement. He may require the
character to receive training to advance.
When training, a character studies his skills
under a tutor. taking the raw knowledge he
has gained and honing it into measurable
improvement. On the average. this takes a
few weeks (depending on the tutor's ability).
and it is normally done during the charac-
ter's nonadventuring time.
A DM can also rule that the circumstanc-
es are not appropriate for the character to
advance in level. For instance, if the game
session ends with the characters deep in an
abandoned mine complex. The party has
just finished a battle with a band of gnolls
and faces more such encounters before it
can reach the surface. The DM rules that the
characters receive no experience until they
leave the mines, because he doesn't want
them to increase in level in the middle of the
adventure. He is perfectly justified in doing
this. And if the characters live through the
adventure, they will undoubtedly proﬁt
from it, either in experience points or
knowledge gained.
Where’s the
Specific Info?
The preceding text
has covered general guidelines as to how
and why characters receive experience
points. Since the DM actually determines
how many XP each character actually
receives, the detailed rules for awarding
experience are given in the Dungeon Mas-
ter's Guide.



The ADkD" game is an adventure game de
signed to give players a feeling of excitement
and danger. Characters brave the unknown
perils of moldering dungeons and thom-
covered wildemess, facing off against hid-
eous monsters and evil villains. Thus, it is
important for all players to know the basic
rules for handling combat.
To create the proper sense of danger and
excitement, the rules for combat must be
thorough. but they must also be playable
and exciting enough to create a vivid picture
in the minds of the players. Combat in the
ADIID game has to allow many different
actions and outcomes—as many as the
imagination can produce. Knowing that
anything could happen next (because the
rules allow it) creates excitement for every-
one.
More Than lust I-lack-and-Slash
As important as
fighting is to the AD&D game, it isn't the be-
all and end-all of play. it's just one way for
characters to deal with situations. lf charac-
ters could do nothing but fight. the game
would quickly get boring—every encounter
would be the same. Because there is more to
the game than fighting, we'll cover much
more than simple hack-and-slash combat in
this chapter.
ln addition to explaining the basic me-
chanics of hitting and missing, there are
rules here for turning undead, special ways
to attack and defend, poison, heroic feats,
and more.
Definitions
Many game terms
are used throughout the combat rules. To
understand the rules. players must under-
stand these terms, so brief explanations ap-
pear below. Further details are provided
throughout this chapter.
Armor Class (AC) is the protective rating
of a type of armor. in some circumstances.
AC is modified by the amount of protection
gained or lost because of the character's situ-
ation. For instance. crouching behind a
boulder improves a character's Armor
Class, while being attacked from behind
worsens his AC.
Annor provides protection by reducing
the chance that a character is attacked suc-
cessfully (and suffers damage). Armor does
not absorb damage, it prevents it. A ﬁghter
in full plate mail may be a slow-moving tar-
get, but penetrating his armor to cause any
damage is no small task.
Armor Class is measured on a scale from
10, the worst (no armor), to "10, the best
(very powerful magical armors). The lower
the number, the more effective the armor.
Shields can also improve the AC of a char-
acter (see page 75).
Chapter 9: COl't‘ll)itt
Abilities and situations can also affect a
character's Armor Class. High Dexterity
gives a bonus to Armor Class, for example.
But even a character with a Dexterity bonus
can have this bonus negated if he is attacked
from the rear.
Damage is what happens to a character
when an opponent attacks him successfully.
Damage can also occur as a result of poison,
fire, falling, acid, and anything even re-
motely dangerous in the real world. Dam-
age from most attacks is measured in hit
points. Each time a character is hit, he suf-
fers points of damage. It could be as little as
1 point to as many as 80 or more. These
points are subtracted from the character's
current hit point total. When this reaches 0,
the character is dead.
initiative detennines the order in which
things happen in a combat round. Like so
many things in the world, initiative is deter-
mined by a combination of ability, situa-
tion, and chance.
At the start of each round of a battle, an
initiative roll is made by both sides. This
roll can be modified by the abilities of the
combatants and by the situation. The per-
son or side with the lower modified die roll
acts first.
Melee is any situation in which charac-
ters are battling each other hand-to-hand,
whether with fists. teeth, claws, swords.
axes, pikes, or something else. Strength and
Dexterity are valuable assets in melee.
Missile combat is defined as any time a
weapon is shot, thrown, hurled, kicked, or
otherwise propelled. Missile and melee
combat have the same basic rules, but there
are special situations and modifiers that ap-
ply only to missile combat.
Saving throws are measures of a charac-
ter's resistance to special types of attach-
poisons, magic, and attacks that affect the
whole body or mind of the character. The
ability to make successful saving throws im-
proves as the character increases in level;
Dexterity and general mental fortitude aid
in honing combat senses. Experience makes
saving throws easier.
Surprise can happen any time dtaracters
meet another group unotpectedly (monsters.
evil knights, peasants. etc.). Surprise is simply
what happens what one side—a person or
party—is taken unawares, unable to react un-
til they gather their wits. Their opponents, if
unsurprised. are allowed a bonus round of
action while the surprised characters recover.
lt's entirely possible for both sides in a given
situation to be surprised!
Attacking with surprise gives bonuses to
the attack roll (see Table 51). A surprised
character also has a decreased chance of
rolling a successful saving throw, if one is
needed.
Surprise is determined by a die roll and is
normally checked at the beginning of an
encounter. Surprise is very unpredictable,
89
s“ "'1
s0 there are very few modifiers to the roll.
THACO is an acronym for "To Hit Armor
Class 0." This is the number a character.
NFC, or monster needs to attack an Armor
Class O target successfully. Tl-[ACO depends
on a character's group and level (see Table
53 on page 91). The THACO number can be
used to calculate the number needed to hit
any Armor Class. THACO is refigured each
time a character increases in level. Using
THACO speeds the play of combat greatly.
The Attack Roll
At the heart of the
combat system is the attack roll. This is the
die roll that determines whether an attack
succeeds or fails. The number a player needs
in order to make a successful attack roll is
also called the "to-hit" number.
Attack rolls are used for attacks with
swords, bows, rocks, and other weapons, as
well as blows from fists. tackling, and other
hand-to-hand attacks. Attack rolls are also
used to resolve a variety of potentially
injury-causing actions that require accuracy
(e.g., throwing a rock at a small target or
tossing a sword to a party member in the
middle of a fight).
figuring the To-Hit Number
The first step in
making an attack roll is to find the number
needed to hit the target. Subtract the Armor
Class of the target from the attackers
THACO. (Remember that if the Armor
Class is a negative number, you add it to the
attackers THACO.) The character has to
roll the resulting number, or higher, on 1d2O
to hit the target.
Here's a simple example: Ruth has
reached 7th level as a fighter. His THACO is
14 (found on Table 53), meaning he needs to
roll a 14 or better to hit a character or crea-
ture of/irmor Class 0. In combat, Ruth. at-
tacking ari on: wearing chainmail armor
(AC 6), needs to rollan 8 (14-6 1 8) to hit
the orc. An 8 or higher on ld20 will hit the
orc. If Ruth hits, he rolls the appropriate
dice (see Table 44) to determine how much
damage he inflicts.
The example above is quite sin-\ple—in a
typical AD&D° game combat situation,
THACO is modiﬁed by weapon bonuses.
Strength bonuses, and the like (the next sec-
tion "Modifiers to the Attack Roll,” lists the
specifics of these modifiers). Figure Strength
and weapon modifiers, subtract the total
from the base THACO, and record this mod-
ified Tl-(ACO with each weapon on the char-
acter sheet. Subtract the target's Armor
Class from this modified THACO when do
termining the to-hit number.



\/5 Combat (Weapon
Here's the same example. with some com-
mon modiﬁers thrown in: Rath is still a 7th-
level fighter. He has n Strength of 18/80
(which gives him a +2 bonus to his attack
roll). He fights with a long sword +1. His
THACO is 14, modified to 12 by his Strength
and to 11 by his weapon. lfattncking the or:
from the earlier example, Rath would have
to roll a 5 or higher on 11120 in order to hit
(11 -6=5). Again, Table 44 would tell him
how much damage he inflicts with his
weapon (this infonnation should also be
written on his character sheet).
The DM may also throw in situational
modifiers, (e.g., a bonus if the target is
struck from behind, or a penalty if the target
is Crouching behind a boulder). If the final,
modified die roll on 'ld20 is equal to or
greater than the number needed to hit the
target, the attack succeeds. lf the roll is
lower than that needed, the attack fails.
Modlﬂers to the Attack Roll
ln combat, many
factors can modify the number a character
needs for a successful hit. These variables
are reﬂected in modifiers to the to-hit num-
ber or to the attack roll.
Strength Modifiers: A characters
Strength can modify the die roll, altering
both the chance to hit and the damage
caused. This modifier is always applied to
melees and attacks with hurled missile
weapons (a spear or an axe).
A positive Strength modifier can be applied
to bows if the character has a special bow
made for him, designed to take advantage of
his high Strength. Characters with Strength
penalties always suffer them when using a
bow weapon. They simply are not able to
draw back the bowstring far enough. Charac-
ters never have Strength modifiers when using
crossbows—the power of the shot is imparted
by a machine, not the player character.
Magical items: The magical properties of
a weapon can also modify combat. Items
that impart a bonus to the attack roll or Ar-
mor Class are identified by a plus sign. For
example, a sword + 1 improves a characters
chance to hit by one. A suit of chain mail
+1 improves the Armor Class of the char-
acter by one (which means you subtract one
from the characters AC, changing an AC of
5 to an AC of 4, for example). Cursed items
have a negative modifier (a penalty), result-
ing in a subtraction from the attack roll or
an addition to Armor Class.
There is no limit to the number of modi-
fiers that can be applied to a single die roll.
Nor is there a limit to the positive or nega-
tive number (the total of all modifiers) that
can be applied to a die roll.
Table 51 lists some standard combat mod-
ifiers. Positive numbers are bonuses for the
attacker; negative numbers are penalties.

Weapon Type vs.
Armor Modlﬂers
(Optional llule)
Not all weapons
perform the same. If they did, there
would be no need for the wide variety of
weapons that exists. Only one form of
each weapon-type, the most useful one,
would be used throughout the world.
This is obviously not the case.
Aside from the differences in size,
weight, length, and shape, certain types
of weapons are more useful against some
types of armor than others. indeed, the
different armors and weapons of the
world are the result of an ancient arms
race. Every new weapon led to the devel-
opment of a new type of armor designed
to counter it. This led to new weapons,
which led to new armor, and so on.
The Various Types of Weapons
ln the ADlcD”
game, weapons fall into several catego-
ries, based onhowtheyareused. Theba—
sic categories are slashing, piercing, and
bludgeoning.
Slnhlng weapon: include swords,
axes, and knives. Damage is caused by
the combination of weight. muscle, and
a good sharp edge.
Piercing weapons (some swords,
spears, pikes, arrows, iavelins, etc.) rely
on the penetrating power of a single
sharp point and much less on the weight
of the weapon.
Bludgeoning weapons (maccs, ham-
mers. and flails) depend almost entirely
on the impact mused by weight and mus-
de.
A few weapons, particularly some of
the more exotic polearms, tall into more
than one of these categories. A halberd
90
can be used as a pole-axe (a slashing
weapon) or as a short pike (a piercing
weapon). The versatility of these weap-
ons provides the user with a combat ad-
vantage, in that the mode most favorable
to the attacker can be used, depending
upon the situation.
Natural weapons can also be classiﬁed
according to their attack type. Claws are
slashing weapons; a bite pierces; a tail-
attack bludgeons. The DM must decide
which is most appropriate to the creature
and method of attack.
Armor types, in tum, have different
qualities. Field plate is more effective,
overall, than other armors by virtue of
the amount and thickness of the metal.
but it still has specific weaknesses against
certain classes of weapons.
Table 52 lists the weapon vs. armor
modifiers applied to the attacker-‘s
THACO, if this optional system is used.
To use this table, the actual armor type of
the target must be known in addition to
the target's Armor Class. The bonuses of
magical armor do not change the type of
armor, only the final Armor Class.
This system is used only when attack-
ing creatures in armor. The modifiers are
not used when attacking creatures with a
natural Armor Class.

Impossible To-lllt Numbers
Sometimes the at-
tacker's to-hit number seems impossible to
roll. An attack may be so difficult it requires
a roll greater than Z0 (on a Z0-sided diet), or
so ridiculously easy it can be made on a roll
less than 1. In both cases, an attack roll is
still required!
The reason is simple: With positive die
roll modifiers (for magic, Strength, situa-
tion, or whatever), a number greater than
20 can be rolled. Likewise, die roll penalties
can push the attack roll below 0.
No matter what number a character needs
Pierce Bludgeon
0 +1



to hit, a roll of 20 is always considered a hit
and a roll of 1 is always a miss, unless the
DM rules otherwise. Under most circum-
stances, a natural 20 hits and a natural 1
misses, regardless of any modifiers applied
to the die roll.
Thus, even if a character's chance to hit a
monster is 23 and the character has a -3
penalty applied to the die roll, he might be
able to score a hit—but only if the die roll is
a 20 before any modifiers are applied. Like-
wise. a character able to hit a monster on a 3
or better, waving a sword 4'4, could still
miss if a 1 is rolled on the die.
There are no sure things, good or bad, in
the unpredictable chaos of combat situa-
tions.

Combat (Calculating THACO) KZ
Calculating THACO
To make an attack
roll, the character's THACO must be known.
This depends on the group and level, if the
attacker is a player character or NFC, or the
Hit Dice if the attacker is a monster or an ani-
mal. All 1st-level characters have THACOs of
20, regardless of clas.
For a character of level 1 through level 20,
consult Table 53. This table lists the THACO
number of each group through 20th level, so
players don't have to perfomi any calcula-
tions.
For a character higher than 20th level,
find the Improvement Rate for the charac-
ter's group in Table $4. There you'll find the
number of levels a character must advance
to reduce his THACO by 1 (or more) points.
Calculate the character's THACO according
to his level.
' The DMG contains the information on
monster THACDS.

Combat and Encounters
Encounters are the
heart of the AD&D@ game. Since encoun-
ters with monsters and NPCs often lead to
combat, an understanding of what happens
during battles is vital for everyone. There
are several factors the DM will consider in
any combat, most of which arise from the
circumstances of the encounter. ls anyone
surprised? How tar apart are the oppo-
nents7 How many of them are there’!
Answers to these questions are found in the
Encounter section of the DMG. These are
questions common to all encounters,
whether combat occurs or not.
The Combat Round
lf an encounter es-
calates into a combat situation, the time
scale of the game automatically goes to
rounds (also called melee rounds or combat
rounds). Rounds are used to measure the
actions of characters in combat (or other
intensive actions in which time is impor-
tant).
A round is approximately one minute
long. Ten combat rounds equal a tum (or.
put another way, a turn equals 10 minutes of
game time). This is particularly important
to remember for spells that last for turns,
rather than rounds.
But these are iust approximations-
precise time measurements are impossible to
make in combat. An action that might be
ridiculously easy under normal circum-
stances could become an undertaking of tw-
ly heroic scale when attempted in the middle
of a furious, chaotic battle.
Imagine the simple act of imbibing a heal-
ing potion. First, a character decides to
drink the potion before retiring for the
night. All he has to do is get it out of his
backpack, uncork it, and drink the con-
tents. No problem.
Now imagine the same thing in the middle
of a fight. The potion is safely stowed in the
character's backpack. First, he takes stock
of the situation to see if anyone else can get
the potion out for him, but, not surprising-
ly, everyone is rather busy. So, sword in one
hand, he shrugs one strap of the pack off his
shoulder. Then, iust as two ores leap toward
him, the other strap threatens to slip down,
entangling his sword arm. Already the loose
strap keeps him from fully using his shield.
Holding the shield as best as possible in
front of him, he scrambles backward to
avoid the monsters’ first wild swinp. He
gets pushed back a few more feet when a
companion shoulders past to block their
advance. His companion bought him a little
time, so he kneels, lays down his sword, and
slips the backpack all the way off. Hearing a
wild cry, he instinctively swings his shield
up just in time to ward off a glancing blow.

Rummaging through the pack, he ﬁnally
finds the potion, pulls it out. and, huddling
behind his shield, works the cork free. lust
then there is a ﬂash of ﬂame all around
him—-a fireball! He grits his teeth against
the heat, shock, and pain and tries to
remember not to crush or spill the potion
vial. Biting back the pain of the ﬂames, he is
relieved to see the potion is still intact.
Quickly, he gulps it down, reclaims his
sword, kicks his backpack out of the way.
and runs back up to the front line. ln game
temis, the character withdrew, was missed
by one attacker, made a successful saving
throw vs. spell (from the fireball), drank a
potion, and was ready for combat the next
round.
What You Can Do In One Round
Whatever the pre-
dse length of a combat round. a character
can accomplish only one basic action in that
round, be it making an attack, casting a
spell, drinking a potion, or tending to a
fallen comrade. The basic action, however,
may involve several lesser actions.
When making an attack, a character is
likely to close with his opponent, circle for
an opening, feint here, lab there, block a
thrust, leap back, and perhaps finally make
a telling blow, A spellcaster may fumble for
his components, dodge an attacker, mental-
ly review the steps of the spell, intone the
spell, and then move to safety when it is all
done. lt has already been shown what
drinking a potion might entail. All of these
things might happen in a bit less than a min-
ute or a bit more, but the standard is one
minute and one action to the round.
Some examples of the actions a character
can accomplish include the following:
I Make an attack (make attack rolls up to
the maximum number allowed the char-
acter class at a given level)
I Cast one spell (if the casting time is one
round or less)
0 Drink a potion
0 Light a torch
I Use a magical item
0 Move to the limit of his movement rate
0 Attempt to open a stuck or secret door
I Bind a character's wounds
I Search a body
i Hammer in a spike
I Recover a dropped weapon
There are also actions that take a negligi-
ble amount of time, things the character
does without affecting his ability to perform
a more important task. Examples of these
include the following:
' Shout warnings. brief instructions, or
demands for surrender, but not conversa-
tions where a reply is expected.
I Change weapons by dropping one and
drawing another.
Combat (The Combat Sequence)
I Drop excess equipment, such as back-
packs, lantems, or torches.
The Combat Sequence
In real life, combat
is one of the closest things to pure anarchy.
Each side is attempting to harm the other.
essentially causing disorder and chaos.
Thus combats are filled with unknowns-
unplanned events. failed attacks, lack of
communication, and general confusion and
uncertainty. However, to play a battle in the
game, it is necessary to impose some order
on the actions that occur. Within a combat
round, there is a set series of steps that must
be followed. These steps are:
1. The DM decides what actions the
monsters or NPCs will take, including
casting spells (if any).
2. The players indicate what their char-
acters will do, including casting spells
(if any).
3. lnitiative is determined.
4. Attacks are made in order of initiative.
These steps are followed until the combat
ends—either one side is defeated, surren-
ders, or runs away.
NPC/Monster Determination: In the first
step, the DM secretly decides in general
tenns what each opponent will do—attack.
ﬂee, or cast a spell. He does not announce
his decisions to the players. If a spell is to be
cast, the DM picks the spell before the play-
ers announce their characters' actions.
Player Determination: Next, the players
give a general indication of what their char-
acters are planning to do. This does not
have to be perfectly precise and can be
changed somewhat, if the DM decides cir-
cumstances warrant.
If the characters are battling goblins, a
player can say, “My fighter will attack"
without having to announce which goblin
he will strike. If the characters are battling a
mixed group of goblins and ogres, the play-
er has to state whether his character is
attacking goblins or ogres.
Spells to be cast must also be announced
at this time and cannot be changed once the
initiative die is rolled.
Before moving on, the DM will make sure
he has a clear idea of not only what the play-
er characters are doing, but also what
actions any hirelings and henchmen are tak-
ing. Once he has a clear view of everything
that's likely to happen, the DM can overrule
any announced action that violates the rules
(or in the case of an NPC, is out of charac-
ter).
He is not required to overnile an impos-
sible action, but he can let a character
attempt it anyway, knowing full well the
character cannot succeed. lt is not the DM's
position to advise players on the best strate-
93
M 
e“ 0
gies, most intelligent actions. or optimum
maneuvers for their characters.
Initiative: In the third step, dice are rolled
to determine initiative, according to the
rules for initiative (this page).
Resolution: in the last step, PCs, NPCs,
and monsters make their attacks, spells
occur, and any other actions are resolved
according to the order of initiative.
The above sequence is not immutable.
Indeed, some monsters violate the standard
sequence, ﬁnd some situations demand the
application of common sense. In these cases
the DM's word is final.
Here's an example of the combat sequence
in action: Ruth is leading a party through
the corridors of a dungeon. Right behind
him nI'2 Rupert and Delsenora. Rounding n
bend, they see a group of ors and trolls
about 20 feet away. No one is surprised by
the encounter.
The DM has notes telling him the orcs are
hesitant, He secretly decides that they will
fall back and let the trolls fight. The trolls,
able to regenerate, are naturally overconfi-
dent and step fonuurd to the front rank
(cursing the orcs at the same time) and pre-
pare to attack. Turning to the players, the
DM asks, “What are you going to do?"
Harry (playing Roth. n dwarf who hates
orcs): "Orcs.7—CHARCE.l"
Anne (playing Delsenora the Mage): "Uh-
whatl? Wait-—-don’! do that...I was
going to...now I can 't use n fireball."
DM: “Roth is charging forward. Quick-
what are you doing?"
Ion (playing Rupert. the half-elf, to Anne):
"Cast iz spell! (To DM) Can lfire my bow
over him?"
DM: "Sure, he's short."
Ion: "OK. I'll shoot at orcs.”
DM: "Anne, tell me what Delsenords doing
or shell lose the round trying to make up
her mind!"
Anne: "Cot it!—Acid arrow spell at the lead
troll."
DM: "Fine. Harry, Ruth is in front. Roll for
initiative.“
lnltlatlve
The initiative roll
detennines who acts first in any given com-
bat round. lnitiative is not set, but changes
from round to round (combat being an
uncertain thing, at best). A character never
knows for certain if he will get to act before
another.
initiative is normally determined with a
single roll for each side in a conﬂict. This
tells whether all the members of the group
get to act before or after those of the other
side(s).
There are also two optional methods that
can be used to detennine initiative. Each of
these optional methods breaks the group

 Combat (Initiative)
action down into more individual initia-
tives. However, the general method of de-
termining initiative remains the same in all
cases.
Standard Initiative Procedure
To determine the
initiative order for a round of combat, roll
1d10 for each side in the battle. Normally,
this means the DM rolls for the monsters (or
NPCs), while one of the players rolls for the
PC party. Low roll wins initiative. lf more
than two sides are involved in combat, the
remaining sides act in ascending order of
initiative.
If both (or all) sides roll the same number
for initiative, everything happens sim-
ultaneously—all attack rolls, damage,
spells, and other actions are completed be-
fore any results are applied. It is possible for
a mage to be slain by goblins who collapse
frorn his sleep spell at the end of the rou.nd.
Initiative Modifiers
Situational factors
can affect who has initiative. To reﬂect this.
modifiers are added to or subtracted from
the initiative die roll.

‘ This applies to situations in which the
party is in a completely different environ-
ment (swimming underwater without the
aid of a ring of free movement, for exam-
plel.
Everyone in the party who will be in-
volved in the round's action must qualify
for the modifier. For example, all members
of a party must be on higher ground than
the opposition in order to get the higher
ground modifier. The DM will probably ask
each player where his character is standing
in order to clarify this.
The side with the lowest modified roll on
'ld1O has the initiative and acts first.
Continuing the example above, the DM
decides that one initiative roll is sufficient
for each group and no modifiers are needed
for either group. (Although Rath is charg-
ing, the arcs and trolls are too busy rear-
ranging their lines to be set to receive his
charge and so the -2 to receive charge is not
used.)
Harry, rolling for the player characters.
gets a 7 on a 10-sided die. The DM rolls a 10.
The player characters. having the lowest
number, art first.
DeLsenora's acid arrow strikes one of the
trolls just as Ruth takes a swing at the last of
the fleeing orcs. A bowshot from Rupert
drops another one of the creatures as it takes
its position in the second rank. Now the
monsters strike back.
The orcs manage to finish forming their
line. Enraged by the acid, the lead troll tears
into Rath, hurting him badly. The others
swarm around him, attempting to tear him
limb from limb.

Some of the modifiers depend on ability.
spell, and weapon. Characters casting spells
(but not monsters using innate abilities)
must add the spellcasting time to the die
roll. Characters attacking with weapons
add the weapons’ speed factors to the die
roll (see pages 68 and 69). All other modi-
fiers are applied according to each individ-
ual‘s situation.
Example: In the second round of the
combat, the DM decids to use the modi-
ﬁed group initiative. Ruth is surrounded
by trolls and not in the best of health.
The rest of the party has yet to close with
the monsters.
The DM decides that one troll will
continue attacking Rath, with the help of
the orcs. while the other trolls move to
block reinforcements. In particular. the
troll bumed by the acid arrow is looking
for revenge. The DM then tums to the
players for their actions.
Players (all at once): "I'm going to. .  "ls
he going?..  "I'm casting a. 
DM (shouting): "One at time! Ruth 7"
Harry: "I'll blow my hom of blasting"
DM: "It'll take time to dig it out."
Harry: "l don't care, l'm doing it."
Ion: "Draw my sword and attack one of
the trolLs!"
DM: "Anne?"
Anne (not paying attention to the other
two): "Cast a ﬁreball."
Harry and Ion: "NOI DON'T!"
DM: "Well, is that what you're doing?
Quickly!"
Anne: "No, I'll cast a haste spell! Cen-
tered on me, so Rupert and Ruth are
just at the edge."
DM: “Okay. Harry, roll initiative and
everyone modify for your actions."
Harry rolls 1d.‘l0 and gets a 6. The DM
rolls for the monsters and gets a 5. Each
persons initiative is modiﬁed as follows:
Rath is using a miscellaneous magical
item (modifier +3). His modified initia-
tiveis9(6 +3 I 9).
Rupert is using a bastard sword +1
with two hands (weapon speed 7 instead
of 8 because of the +1). His modiﬁed ini-
tiative is 13 (6 4' 7 I 13).
Delsenora is casting a spell (haste
spell, casting time 3). Her modified ini-
tiative is the same as Ruth 's. 9.
The trolLs are attacking with their
claws and bites (large creatures attacking
with natural weapons +6). Their modi-
fied initiative is 11 (5 + 6 I 11).
The arts are using long swords (weap-
on speed 5). Their modiﬁed initiative is
10 (5 + 5 I 10).
After all modiﬁed initiatives are fig-
ured, the combat round goes as follows:
Delsenora (initiative 9) completes her
spell at the same time that Ruth (9) brings
the house down on the orcs with his horn
of blasting.
The orm (initiative 10) would have
gone next. but all of them have been
crushed under falling rock.
The three trolls (initiative 11) are
unfazed and attack, one at Rath and the
other two springing forward, hitting
Delsenora and mbsing Rupert.
Finally, Rupert (initiative 13) strikes
back. He moved too slowly to block one
troll's path to Delsenoru, but manages to
cut off the second. Things look very grim
for the player characters.
lndlvldual lnltlatlve
(Optional Rule)
This method of
determining initiative is the same as that
just given earlier, except that each PC,
NPC. and monster involved in the fight
rolls and then modifies his own initiative
roll. This gives combat a more realistic
feel, but at the expense of quick play.
To players, it may not seem like too
much for each to roll a separate initiative
die, but consider the difficulties: imagine
a combat between six player characters
(each controlled by a player) and ﬁve
hirelings and henchmen against 16 hob-
goblins and five ogre: (all of which must
be rolled by the DM).
Furthermore. each die roll must be
modiﬁed according to each individuals
actions. The resulting rolls make every
combat round a major calculation.
This method is not recommended for
large-scale combats. lt is best used with
small battles in which characters on the
same side have vastly different speeds.
Erample: In the third round of com-
bat, the DM decides to use individual ini-
tiativs. Each character is involved in his
own ﬁght and there aren't too many to
deal with. Cut off from retreat by fallen
rock. the trolls attack. The DM asks the
players their intentions.
Harry: "Hit him with my hammer +41"
Rupert: “Chop him 
Anne (now in serious trouble): “Cast a
burning hands spell."
Each character or monster now rolls
1d10. The rolls and modiﬁed results are:
Roth rolls a 2 and is attacking with his
hammer (weapon speed D instead of 4
due to +4) and is hasted (-2), so his
modiﬁed initiative is 0.
Ruth's troll rolls a 1 and is attacking
with natural weapons (+6 modiﬁer) for
atotalof7(1 + 6 " 7).
95

Combat (Initiative)
Q‘ 1
Rupert rolls a 2 and has a weapon
speed of 7 and is hasted (-2) for a modi-
fied initiative of 7 (2 + 7-2 I 7).
Rupert’: troll rolls a 5 and modiﬁes
this by +6foran 11 (5 + 6 - 11).
Delsenora is very unlucky and rolls a
9. Since she is casting a spell, she gains no
beneﬁt from the haste spell this round.
She has a casting time of 1 for a total of
10 (9 + 1 I 10).
The troll ﬁghting Delsenora is very
quick and rolls a 1, modiﬁed to 7 (1 + 6
= 7.)
The order of attaclc is: Ruth (initiative
0) strikes with his hammer. Rupert and
the two trolls (attacking Ruth and
Delsenora, all initiative 7) attack imme-
diately after. Rupert hits. The troll
attacking Ruth misses, but Delsenora B
hit. Delsenoras spell (initiative 10)
would normally happen next, but
instead it fizzles, her concentration
ruined by the blow from the troll. Next,
Ruperts troll attacks and misses.
Because of the haste spell, Rath and
Rupert now attack again (in order of ini-
tiative), Rath first, then Rupert.
Multiple Attacks and lnltlntlve
Often combat in-
volves creatures or characters able to attack
more than once in a single round. This may
be due to multiple attack forms (claws and
bite), skill with a weapon, or character
level. No matter what the reason, all multi-
ple attacks are handled by one of two meth-
ods.
When multiple attacks are the result of
different attack fonns—claws and a bite or
bite and tail or a ranger with his two-
weapon combat ability for example—the
attacks all occur at the same time. The crea-
ture resolves all of its attacks in initiative
order.
When the attacks are true multiples—-
using the same weapon more than once—as
in the case of a highly skilled fighter, the
attacks are staggered. Everyone involved in
the combat completes one action before the
second (or subsequent) attack roll is made.
Take, for example, a ﬁghter who can
attack twice per round, and say he's battling
creatures that can only make one attack.
The ﬁghter wins initiative. He makes his
first attack according to the rolled i.nitiative
order. Then each creature gets its attack.
Finally, the fighter gets his second attack.
lf fighters on both sides in a battle were
able to attack twice in the round, their first
attacks would occur according to the initia-
tive roll. Their second attacks would come
after all other attacks, and would then alter-
nate according to the initiative roll.



\
.k
e‘ %
Spellcastlng and lnltlatlve
Casting times for
spells can modify initiative rolls, creating a
realistic delay for the spellcaster. When a
spell’s "Casting Time" parameter is given as
a number without any units (e.g., rounds or
turns), then that number is added to the
caster's initiative roll to determine his modi-
fied initiative. When a spell requires a round
or more to cast, a normal initiative roll is
not made-—a spell requiring one round to
cast takes effect at the end of the current
round, after all other actions are completed.
Spells that require more than one round
to cast involve some bookkeeping. The DM
or one of the players must keep track of the
rounds spent in casting. If the spellcasting
character is disturbed during this time, the
spell is lost. lf all goes well, the spell takes
effect at the very end of the last round of the
required casting time. Thus, a spell requir-
ing 10 minutes to cast would require 10
combat rounds, and wouldn't take effect
until the very end of the 10th round.
Weapon Speed and lnltlatlve
(Optlonal Rule)
Pach time a char-
acter swin§ a weapon, he places himself
out of position to make his next attack.
Swingi.ngahacrunerisnotassimpleasta|>-
pinginanail.Awarhammerisheavy.
Swingitinonedirectionanditpullsinthat
direaion. lt has to be brought under oun-
trol and repositioned before it can be
swung again. The user must regain his bal-
anoeandplanthisfeetfirmly.Onlyafter
doingallthisishereadyforhisnertattack.
Compare how quickly someone can
throw a punch to the amount of time re-
quired to swing a chair to get a good idea
of what weapon speed factors are about.
Weapon speed factors slow the speed
of a character's attack. The higher the
weapon speed factor. the heavier, clum-
sier, or more limited the weapon is. For
the most part, weapon speed factors ap-
ply to all Geatures using manufactured
weapons. The speed factor of a weapon
is added to the initiative roll of the char-
acter to get his modified initiative roll.
Thus, if the DM decides to use weapon
speed factors for player characters, they
should also be used for giants, arcs. cen-
taurs. and the like. Otherwise the DM
isn't being fair to the players. However,
creatures with natural weapons are not
affected by weapon speed. Their attacks
are natural extensions of their bodies,
giving them much faster recovery and re-
action times.
Combat (Two Weapons)
Magical Weapon Speeds
Magical weapons are easier to wield in
combat than ordinary ones. Maybe the
weapon is lighter or better balanced than
normal; maybe it lust pulls the character
into the proper poﬂtion of its own voli-
tion. Whatever the cause, each bonus
point conferred by a magical weapon re-
duces the speed factor of that weapon by
1. (A sword +3 reduces the weapon
speed factor by 3, for example.) When a
weapon has two bonuses, the lesser one
is used. No weapon can have a qaeed fac-
tor of lss than 0.
Attacking with
Two Weapons
A tricky fighting
style available only to warriors and rogues
is that of lighting with two weapons simul-
taneously. The character chooses not to use
a shield in favor of another weapon, grant-
ing him a greater number of attacks, with a
penalty to his attack rolls (rangers are ex-
empt from the attack roll penalty).
When using a second weapon in his off-
hand, a character is limited in his weapon
choice. His principal weapon can be what-
ever he chooses, provided it can be wielded
with one hand. The second weapon must be
smaller in size and weight than the charac-
ter's rnain weapon (though a dagger can al-
ways be used as a second weapon, even if
the primary weapon is also a dagger). A
fighter can use a long sword and a short
sword, or a long sword and a dagger, but he
cannot use two long swords. Nor can the
character use a shield, unless it is kept
strapped onto his back.
When attacking, all characters but rang-
ers suffer penalties to their attack rolls. At-
tacks rnade with the main weapon suffer a
-2 penalty, and attacks made with the sec-
ond weapon suffer a -4 penalty. The char-
acter's Reaction Adjustment (based on his
Dexterity, see Table 2) modifim this penalty.
A low Dexterity score will worsen the char-
acter's chance to hit with each attack. A
high Dexterity can negate this particular
penalty. although it cannot result in a posi-
tive modifier on the attack rolls for either
weapon (i.e., the Reaction Adjustment can,
at best, raise the attack roll penalties to 0).
The use of two weapons enables the char-
acter to make one additional attack each
combat round, with the second weapon.
The character gains only one additional at-
tack each round, regardless of the number
of attacks he may normally be allowed.
Thus a warrior able to attack 3/2 (once in
the first round and twice in the second) can
attack 5/2 (twice in the first round and three
times in the second).
96
Movement ln Combat
Since a round is
roughly a minute long, it should be easy for
a character to move just about anywhere he
wants during the course of the round. After
all, Olympic-class sprinters can cover vast
amounts of ground in a minute.
However, a character in an AD&D“ game
is not an Olympic sprinter running in a
straight line. He is trying to maneuver
through a battle without getting killed. He is
keeping his eyes open for trouble, avoiding
surprise, watching his back, watching the
backs of his partners, and looking for a
good opening, while simultaneously plan-
ning his next move, sometimes through a
haze of pain. He may be carrying a load of
equipment that slows him dovnm signifi-
cantly. Because of all these things, the dis-
tance a character can move is signiﬁcantly
less than players generally think,
In a combat round, a being can move up
to 10 times its movement rating (see Chap-
ter 14) in feet. Thus, if a character has a
movement rating of 9. he can move up to 90
feet in a round. However, the types of
moves a character can make during combat
are somewhat limited.
Movement In Melee
The basic move is
to get closer for combat—i.e., move close
enough to an enemy to attack. This is nei-
ther a blind rush nor a casual stroll. Instead.
the character approaches quickly but with
caution. When closing for combat, a char-
acter can move up to half his allowed dis-
tance and still make a melee attack.
Movement and Mlsslle Combat
Rather than slug it
out toe to toe with an opponent. a character
can move up to one-half his normal move-
ment rate and engage in missile fire at half
his normal rate of fire. Thus a man capable
of moving 120 feet and armed with a long
bow (two shots per round, under normal
circumstances) could move 60 feet and still
fire one shot. The same man, armed with a
heavy crossbow (one shot every other
round) would be able to shoot only once
every four rounds while on the move.
Charging an Opponent
A character can
also charge a foe. A charge increases the
characters movement rate by 50% and en-
ables the character to make an attack at the
end of his movement. A charging character
also gains a +2 bonus to his attack roll.
mainly from momentum. Certain weapons
(such as a lance) inflict double the rolled
damage in a charge.



However, charging gives the opponents
several advantages. First, they gain a -2
bonus to their initiative rolls. Second,
charging characters gain no Dexterity bo-
nuses to Armor Class and they suffer an AC
penalty of 1. Finally, if the defender is using
a spear or polearrn weapon and sets it
against the charge (bracing the butt against
a stone or his foot), he inflicts double dam-
age on a successful hit.
Retreat
To get out of a com-
bat, characters can make a careful with-
drawal or they can simply flee.
Withdrawing: When making a with-
drawal, a character carefully backs away
from his opponent (who can choose to fol-
lowl. The character moves up to '/a his nor-
mal movement rate.
if two characters are fighting a single op-
ponent and one of them decides to with-
draw. the remaining character can block the
advance of the opponent. This is a useful
method for getting a seriously injured man
out of a combat.
Fleeing: To ﬂee from combat, a character
simply turns and runs up to his full move-
ment rate. However, the ﬂeeing character
drops his defenses and tums his back to his
opponent.
The enemy is allowed a free attack (or
multiple attacks if the creature has several
attacks per round) at the rear of the ﬂeeing
character. This attack is made the instant
the character ﬂees; it doesn't count against
the number of attacks that opponent is al-
lowed during the round, and initiative is ir-
relevant.
The ﬂeeing character can be pursued. un-
less a companion blocks the advance of the
enemy.
Attacking Without Killing
There are times
when a character wants to defeat another
being without killing it. A companion may
have been charmed into attacking his
friends (and his friends don't want to kill
him to save themselvest); an enemy may
have information the PCs can get only by
subduing him; characters may simply see
the monetary value of bringing back a real,
live monster. Whatever the case, sooner or
later characters are going to try.
There are three types of nonlethal
attacks-—punching, wrestling, and over-
bearing. Punching is basic bare-fisted fight-
ing. Wrestling is the classic combination of
grappling. holds. and throws. Overbearing
is simply trying to pull down an opponent
by sheer mass or weight of numbers, pin-
ning him to the ground.
Combat (Attacking Without Killing)
Punching and Wrestling
These are the most
basic of combat skills, unknowingly prac-
ticed by almost all children as they rough
and tumble with each other. Thus all char-
acters, regardless of class, are assumed to be
somewhat proficient in both these forms of
fighting.
Punching occurs when a character attacks
with his fists. No weapons are used, al-
though the character can wear an iron
gauntlet or similar item. Wrestling requires
both hands free, unencumbered by shields
and the like.
l/Vhen punching or wrestling, a nonnal at-
tack roll is made. The normal Armor Class
of the target is used. if a character is at-
tempting to wrestle in armor, the modifiers
on Table 57 are used (these are penalties to
the attackers attack roll). Normal modifiers
to the attack roll are also applied.
Penalties for being held or attacking a
held opponent do not apply to wrestlers.

u“ ’-‘a
Wrestling involves a lot of holding and
twisting as it is, and the damage resolution
system for punching and wrestling takes this
into account.

Punch: This is the type of blow landed. ln
game terms, the type of blow has little
effect, but using the names adds spice to the
battle and makes the DM’s job of describing
the action easier.
Damage: Bare-handed attacks cause only
1 or 2 points of damage. Metal gau.ntlets.
brass knuckles, and the like cause 1d3
points of damage. A character's Strength
bonus. if any, does apply to punching
attacks.
Punching damage is handled a little dif-
ferently than normal damage. Only 25% of
the damage caused by a bare-handed attack
is normal damage. The remaining 75% is
temporary. For the sake of convenience.
record punching damage separately from
other damage and calculate the percentage
split at the end of all combat.
If a character reaches 0 hit points due to
punching attacks (or any combination of
punching and normal attacks). he imrnedi-
ately falls unconscious.
A character can voluntarily pull his
punch, not causing any hit point damage,
provided he says so before the damage is
applied to his enemy. There is still a chance
of a knockout.
% K.O.: Although a punch does very lit-
tle damage, there is a chance of knocking an
opponent out. This chance is listed on the
table as "% K.O." If this number or less is
rolled on percentile dice, the victim is
stunned for 1d10 rounds.
Wrestle: Th.is lists the action or type of
grip the character managed to get. Wres-
tling moves marked with a.n asterisk (‘) are
holds maintained from round to round,
unless they are broken. A hold is broken by
a throw, a gouge, the assistance of another
person, or the successful use of a weapon.
(Penalties to the attack roll apply to weapon
attacks by a character who is in a hold.)
All wrestling moves inﬂict 1 point of
damage plus Strength bonus (if the attacker
desires), while continued holds cause cumu-
latively 1 more point of damage for each
round they are held. A head lock held for six
rounds would inﬂict 21 points of damage
total (1 +2 +3 +4 +5 +6). Remember, this is
the equivalent of pressing hard on a full-
nelson headlock for roughly six minutes!
Overbearlng
Sometimes the most
effective attack is simply to pull an oppo-
nent down by sheer numbers. No attempt is
made to gain a particular hold or even to
harm the victim. The only concern is to pin
and restrain him.
To overbear an opponent, a normal
attack roll is made. For every level of size
difference (1 if a Large attacker takes on a
Medium defender, for example), the attack
roll is modified by 4 (+4 if the attacker is
larger; -4 if the defender is larger).
Combat (Touch Spells)
The defender also gains a benefit if it has
more than two legs: a *2 penalty to the
attackers roll for every leg beyond two.
There is no penalty to the defender if it has
no legs. A lone orc attempting to pull down
a horse and rider would have at least a -8
penalty applied to the attack roll (-4 for
size and -4 for the horse's four legs).
if the attack succeeds. the opponent is
pulled down. A character can be pinned if
further successful overbearing attacks are
rolled each round. For pinning purposes, do
not use the prone modifier to combat (from
Table 51).
lf multiple attackers are all attempting to
pull down a single target, make only one
attack roll with a + 1 bonus for each attack-
er beyond the first. Always use the to-hit
number of the weakest attacker to figure the
chance of success, since cooperation always
depends on the weakest link. Modifiers for
size should be ﬁgured for the largest attack-
er of the group.
A giant and three pixies attempting to
pull down a man would use the pixies’
attack roll. modified by +3 for three extra
attackers and +8 for the size difference of
the giant (Huge) and the man (Medium).
Weapons In Non-lethal Combat
As you might ex-
pect, weapons have their place in non-lethal
combat, whether a character is defending or
pressing the attack.
Weapons in Defense: A character
attempting to punch, wrestle, or overbear
an armed opponent can do so only by plac-
ing himself at great risk. Making matters
worse, an armed defender is automatically
allowed to strike with his weapon before the
unarmed attack is made, regardless of the
initiative die roll. Furthermore, since his
opponent must get very close, the defender
gains a +4 bonus to his attack and damage
rolls. lf the attacker survives, he can then
attempt his attack.
Those involved in a wrestling bout are
limited to weapons of small size after the
first round of combat-—it’s very difficult to
use a sword against someone who is twist-
ing your sword arm or clinging to your
back, trying to break your neck. For this
reason, nearly all characters will want to
carry a dagger or a knife.
Non-Lethal Weapon Attacks: lt is possi-
ble to make an armed attack without caus-
ing serious damage (striking with the ﬂat of
the blade, for example). This is not as easy
as it sounds. however.
First, the character must be using a weap-
on that enables him to control the damage
he inﬂicts. This is impossible with an arrow
or sling. It isn't even feasible with a war
hammer or mace. lt can be done with
swords and axes, as long as the blade can be
tumed so it doesn't cut.
98
Second, the character has a ‘-4 penalty to
his attack roll, since handling a weapon in
this way is clumsier than usual. The damage
from such an attack is 50% normal; one
half of this damage is temporary.
Non-lethal Combat and Creatures
When dealing with
non-humanoid opponents, a number of fac-
tors must be considered.
First, unintelligent creatures, as a rule,
never try to grapple, punch, or pull down
an opponent. They cheerfully settle for tear-
ing him apart, limb by limb. This, to their
small and animalistic minds, is a better solu-
tion.
Second, the natural weapons of a creature
are always usable. Unlike men with swords,
a lion or a camivorous ape doesn't lose the
use of its teeth and fangs just because a char-
acter is very close to it.
Finally, and of greatest importance. crea-
tures tend to be better natural fighters than
humans. All attacks for a tiger are the same
as punching or wrestling. lt's just that the
tiger has claws! Furthermore, a tiger can use
all of its legs effectively—front and back.
Touch Spells and Combat
Many spells used
by priests and wizards take effect only when
the target is touched by the caster. Under
normal circumstances. this is no problem-
the spellcaster reaches out and touches the
recipient. However, if the target is unwill-
ing, or the spell is used in the midst of a gen-
eral melee. the situation is much different.
Unwllling Targets: The spellcaster must
make a successful attack roll for the spell to
have any effect. The wizard or priest calcu-
lates his to-hit number normally, according
to the intended victim's Armor Class and
other protections. The DM can modify the
roll if the victim is unprepared for or
unaware of the attack. lf the roll succeeds,
the spellcaster touches the target and the
normal spell effect occurs.
Willing Targets: When attempting to cast
a spell on a willing target, the casting is
automatic as long as both characters are not
engaged in combat. For example, if a fighter
withdraws from melee, a cleric could heal
him the next round.
lf the recipient of the spell attempts to do
anything besides waiting for the spell to
take effect, an attack roll against AC 10
must be made. However, no AC modifiers
for Dexterity are applied, since the target is
not trying to avoid the spell!
Whenever a touch spell is successful, the
spellcaster suffers from any special defenses
of his target. if they are continually in oper-
ation. A successful touch to a vampire
would not result in energy drain, since the
power only works when the vampire wills



it, but touching a fire elemental would result
in serious burns.
When a touch spell is cast, it nomially re-
mains effective only for that round. How-
ever, certain spells do specify special
conditions or durations. Be sure to check
each spell description carefully.
Mlsslle Weapons
In Combat
ln general, missile
combat is handled identically to standard
melee. Intentions are announced, initiative
is rolled, and attack rolls are made. How-
ever, there are some special rules and situa-
tions that apply only to missile combat.
Missile weapons are divided into two gen-
eral categories. The first includes all stand-
ard, direct-fire, single-target missiles
—slings, arrows, quarrels, spears, throwing
axes. and the like.
The second category includes all grenade-
like missiles that have an area effect, no
matter how small. Thus an attack with these
weapons does not have to hit its target di-
rectly to have a chance of affecting it. In-
cluded in this group are small flasks of oil,
acid, poison, holy water, potions, and boul-
ders. Hurled boulders are included because
they bounce and bound along after they hit.
leaving a swath of destruction.
Range
The first step in
making a missile attack is to find the range
from the attacker to the target. This is mea-
sured in yards from one point to the other.
This distance is compared to the range cate
gories for the weapon used (see Table 45 in
Chapter 6).
If the distance is greater than the long
range given. the target is out of range; if the
distance is between the long- and medium-
range numbers. the target is at long range;
when between the medium- and short-range
numbers, medium range is used; when equal
to or less than the short-range distance, the
target is at short range.
Short-range attacks suffer no range modi-
fier. Medium-range attacks suffer a -2 pen-
alty to the attack roll. Long-range attacks
suffer a - 5 penalty. Some weapons have no
short range since they must arc a certain dis-
tance before reaching their target. These at-
tacks are always made with an attack roll
penalty.
Rate of Flre
Bows, crossbows,
and many other missile weapons have dif-
ferent rates of fire (ROF)-the number of
missiles they can shoot in a single round.
Small, light weapons can be thrown very
\
Combat (Missile Weapons) \
quickly, so up to three darts can be thrown
in a single round. Arrows can be nocked
and let loose almost as quickly, so up to two
shots can be fired in a single round.
Some weapons (such as heavy crossbows)
take a long time to load and can be fired
only every other round.
Whatever the ROF, multiple missile shots
are handled the same way as other multiple
attacks for the purposes of determining ini-
tiative. The ROF of each missile weapon is
listed in table 45 in Chapter 6.
Ablllty Modlﬂers In Mlsslle Combat
Attack roll and dam-
damage modifiers for Strength are always
used when an attack is made with a hurled
weapon. Here the power of the character's
arm is a significant factor in the effective-
ness of the attack.
When using a bow, the attack roll and
damage Strength modifiers apply only if the
character has a properly prepared bow (see
Chapter 6: Money and Equipment). Char-
acters never receive Strength bonuses when
using crossbows or similar mechanical de-
vices.
Dexterity modifiers to the attack roll are
applied when making a missile attack with a
hand-held weapon. Thus, a character adds
his Dexterity modifier when using a bow,
crossbow, or axe but not when firing a tre-
buchet or other siege engine.
Ilrlng Into a Melee
Missile weapons
are intended mainly as long-range weapons.
ldeally, they are used before the opponents
reach your line. However, ideal situations
are all too rare, and characters often dis-
cover that the only effective way to attack is
to shoot arrows (or whatever) at an enemy
already in melee combat with their compan-
ions. While possible, and certainly allowed,
this is a risky proposition.
When missiles are fired into a melee, the
DM counts the number of figures in the im-
mediate area of the intended target. Each
Medium figure counts as 1. Small (S) ﬁgures
count as 1/z, Large as 2, Huge as 4, and Gar-
gantuan as 6. The total value is compared to
the value of each character or creature in the
target melee. Using this ratio, the DM rolls a
die to determine who (or what) will be the
target of the shot.
For example, Tams Bloodheart (man-size,
or 1 point) and Ruth (also man-size, or 1
point) are ﬁghting a giant (size C, 6 points)
while Thule fires a long bow at the giant.
The total value of all possible targets is 8
(6+1-1'1). Theres a I in 8 chance that Rath
is the target; a 1 in 8 chance that Tarus is hit;
and a 6 in B chance the shot hits the giant.
99
e‘ ’o
The DM could roll an 8-sided die to deter-
mine who gets hit, or he could reduce the ra-
tios to a percentage (75 % chance the giant is
hit, etc.) and roll percentile dice.
Taking Cover Against Nllsslle Flre
One of the best
ways to avoid being hit and injured is to
hide behind something—a wall, a tree. a
building comer, a heap of boulders. or
whatever happens to be available. Profes-
sional adventurers, wishing to make this
sound heroic, call this taking cover.
Taking cover doesn't work particularly
well in a melee, since the cover hampers de-
fender and attacker equally. However, it is
quite an effective tactic against missile fire.
There are two types of protection a char-
acter can have. The first is concealment.
also called soft cover. A character hiding be
hind a clump of bushes is concealed. He can
be seen, but only with difficulty, and it's no
easy task to determine exactly where he is.
The bushes cannot stop an arrow, but they
do make it less likely that the character is
hit. Other types of concealment include cur-
tains, tapestries, smoke. fog, and brambles.
The other type of protection is cover,
sometimes called, more precisely, hard
cover. lt is. as its name implies, something a
character can hide behind that will block a
missile. Hard cover includes stone walls, the
comer of a building, tables, doors. earth
embankments, tree trunks, and magical
walls of force.
Cover helps a potential target by giving
the attacker a negative modifier to his at-
tack roll. The exact modifier for conceal-
ment or cover depends on the degree to
which it is being used as shelter. A character
who stands behind a two-foot wall is a
pretty obvious target, especially when com-
pared to the character who lies down behind
that wall and carefully peers over it. Table
59 lists the different modifiers for varying
degrees of cover and concealment.
Table 59: COVER AND CONCEALMENT

- 4 -2
_ 7 _
_ 10 _
Target ls:
25% hidden

Cover also has an affect on saving
throws, granting the character the modifier
listed on Table 59 as a bonus to his saving
throws against spells that cause physical
damage (e.g., fireball, lightning bolt, etC.).
Furthennore, a character who has 90%
cover (or more) suffers one-half normal
damage on a failed save and no damage at
all if a saving throw is successful. This



\ / _
assumes, of course, that the fireball, light-
ning bolt, or whatever, hit the cover—a
man crouching behind a stone wall would
be protected if a fireball exploded in front of
the wall, but would not be protected by cov-
er if the blast occurred behind him, on his
side of the wall.
Grenade-lllte Missiles
Unlike standard
missiles, which target a specific creature, a
grenadelike missile is aimed at a point,
whether this point is a creature or a spot on
the ground. When the attack is announced,
the player indicates where he wants the mis-
sile to land. This then becomes the target
point and is used to determine the direction
and distance of any scatter.
Most grenade-like missiles are items of
opportunity or necessity—rocks, ﬂasks of
oil, vials of holy water, or beakers of acid.
As such, these items are not listed on the
equipment tables for range, ROF. and dam-
age. The range each can be thrown varies
with the Strength of the character and the
weight of the object.
A missile of five pounds or less can be
thrown about 30 feet. Short range is 10 feet,
medium range is 20 feet, and everything
beyond is maximum range. Heavier items
have reduced ranges. lust how far an object
can be thrown is decided by the DM.
Exceptionally heavy items can be thrown
only if the character rolls a successful bend
bars/lift gates check. in no case can a char-
acter throw an item heavier than his
Strength would allow him to lift. Thus, the
DM can rule that a character would have lit-
tle trouble chucking a half-empty backpack
across a ten-foot chasm, but the character
would need to make a check in order to
heave an orc ten feet through the air into the
faces of his orcish friends.
Once a container hits, it normally breaks
immediately. However, this is not always
true. Some missiles, like soft leather flasks
or hard pottery, are particularly resistant. If
there's some doubt about whether or not a
thrown object will break, the DM can
require an item saving throw (this informa-
tion is in the DMG) to see if it shatters or
rips, spewing its contents everywhere.
The DMG contains information on how
to resolve the inevitable situations in which
grenade-like missiles miss their targets.
Types of Grenade-like Mlsslles
Acid damage is par-
ticularly grim. Aside from the possibility of
scarring (which is left to the DM), acid dam-
age cannot be healed by regeneration. lt
must be healed normally. Thus it is very use-
ful against regenerating creatures such as
trolls. Acid is very rare.
Holy Water affects most fon'ns of undead
Combat (Parrying)
and creatures from the lower planes. It has
no effect against a creature in gaseous form
or undead without material form.
Unholy water (essentially holy water
used by evil priests) affects paladins, crea-
tures whose purpose is to defend good (lam-
masu, shedu, etc.), and creatures and beings
from the upper planes.
Holy (or unholy) water affects creatures
as does add, causing damage that cannot be
regenerated but must be healed normally.
Oil causes damage only when it is lit. This
normally requires a two-step process—first
soaking the target in ﬂammable oil and then
setting it afire. Thus using flaming oil often
requires two successful attacks.
A direct hit from flaming oil bums for
two rounds, causing 2d6 points of damage
in the first round and 1d6 points in the sec-
ond round.
Poison is generally not very effective as a
missile weapon. Most poisons take effect
only if the missile scores a direct hit, and
even then only if it drops into the gaping
maw of some huge creature. Contact poi-
sons have normal poison effects on a direct
hit. The DM has information about specific
poison effects in the DMG.
Special Defenses
So far, the bulk of this
chapter has dealt with ways to attack. Now,
it’s time to tum to defense. There are several
ways to avoid taking damage. Two of the
rnost common are the saving throw and
magic resistance. Somewhat less common,
because its use is limited to clerics and pala-
dins, is the ability to tum undead.
Parrylng (Optional ltule)
During a one-
minute combat round, each character is
assumed to block many attempted
attacks and see many of his own attacks
blocked. in normal combat, characters
parryalltheﬁme-—there'snoneedtosin-
gle out each parry.
When a character deliberately diooses
not to parry (a mag: mating a spell. for
instance), his chance of being hit
increases. Thus. choosing to pa,-ry, in
and of itself, is not a separate option
under the AD&D' pme rule.

The Saving Throw
The saving throw is
a die roll that gives a chance, however slim,
that the character or creature finds some
way to save himself from certain destruc-
tion (or at least lessen the damage of a suc-
cessful attack).
More often than not, the saving throw
represents an instinctive act on the part of
the character—diving to the ground just as a
fireball scorches the group, blanking the
mind just as a mental battle begins; blocking
the worst of an acid spray with a shield. The
exact action is not important—DMs and
players can think of lively and colorful
explanations of why a saving throw suc-
ceeded or failed. Explanations tailored to
the events of the moment enhance the
excitement of the game.
ltolllng Saving Throws
To make a saving
throw, a player rolls a Z(¥sided die (1d2O).
The result must be equal to or greater than
the character's saving throw number. The
number a character needs to roll varies
depending upon the character's group, his
level, and what the character is trying to
save himself from. A character's saving
throw numbers can be found in Table 60.
Saving throws are made in a variety of
situations: For attacks involving paralyza-
tion, poison, or death magic; petrification
or polymorph; rod, staff, or wand; breath
weapon; and spells. The type of saving
throw a character must roll is determined by
the specific spell, monster, magical item, or
situation involved.
Monsters also use Table 60. The DM has
specific infonnation about monster saving
throws.

" Excluding those that cause petrification or polymorph.
’ ' ' Excluding those for which another saving throw type is specified, such as death, petrifica-
tion, polymorph, etc.
Saving Throw Priority
Sometimes the type
of saving throw required by a situation or
item isn't clear, or more than one category
of saving throw may seem appropriate. For
this reason, the saving throw categories in
Table 60 are listed in order of importance,
beginning with paralyzation. poison, and
death magic, and ending with spells.
Imagine that Rath is struck by the ray
from a wand of pol;/morphing. Both a sav-
ing throw vs. wands and a saving throw vs.
polymorph would be appropriate. But Rath
must roll a saving throw vs. wands because
that category has a higher priority than
polymorph.
The categories of saving throws are as fol-
lows:
Save vs. Paraiyzation, Poison, and Death
Magic: This is used whenever a character is
affected by a paralyzing attack (regardless
of source). poison (of any strength), or cer-
tain spells and magical items that otherwise
kill the character outright (as listed in their
descriptions). This saving throw can also be
used in situations in which exceptional force
of will or physical fortitude are needed.
Save vs. Rod, Staff, ol‘ Wand: As its name
implies, this is used whenever a character is
affected by the powers of a rod, staff, or
wand. provided another save of higher pri-
ority isn't called for. This saving throw is
sometimes specified for situations in which
a character faces a magical attack from an
unusual source.
Save vs. Petrification or Polymorph: This
is used any time a character is tumed to
stone (petrified) or polymorphed by a mon-
ster, spell. or magical item (other than a
wand). lt can also be used when the charac-
ter must withstand some massive physical
alteration of his entire body.
Save vs. Breath Weapon: A character uses
this save when facing monsters with breath
weapons, Particularly the powerful blast of
a dragon. This save can also be used in situ-
ations where a combination of physical
stamina and Dexterity are critical factors in
survival.
Save vs. Spell: This is used whenever a
character attempts to resist the effects of a
magical attack, either by a spellcaster or
from a magical item. provided no other type
IOI
\ Q
of saving throw is specified. This save can
also he used to resist an attack that defies
any other classification.
Voluntarily Falling Saving Throws
No save is made if
the target voluntarily chooses not to resist
the effect of a spell or special attack. This is
the case even if the character was duped as
to the exact nature of the spell. When a char-
acter announces that he is not resisting the
spells power, that spell (or whatever) has its
full effect.
The intention not to resist must beclearly
stated or set up through trickery, however.
if a character is attacked by surprise or
caught unawares. he is normally allowed a
saving throw. The DM can modify this sav-
ing throw, making the chance of success
worse, if the situation warrants it. Only in
extreme cases of trickery and deception
should an unwitting character be denied a
saving throw.
Ability Checks as Saving Throws
When a character
attempts to avoid danger through the use of
one of his abilities, an ability check can be
used in lieu of a saving throw.
For example, Ragnar the thief has broken
into someone's home when he hears a grat-
ing noise from the ceiling above him. He
looks up to find a five-ton block of the ceil-
ing headed straight for himl He is going to
need speedy reactions to get out of the way,
so a Dexterity ability check should be rolled
to see if he avoids the trap.
Modifying Saving Throws
Saving throws can
be modified by magical items, specific rules,
and special situations. These modifiers can
increase or decrease the chance of a success-
ful saving throw.
Modifiers that increase the chance are
given as a number preceded by a plus sign.
Modifiers that make success more difficult
are given as a number preceded by a minus
sign (-1, -2, etct).
Saving throw modifiers affect a charac-
ter's die roll, not the saving throw number
needed. Thus. if Delsenora needed an 11 for
a successful saving throw vs. petrification
and had a +1 bonus to her save, she would
still need to roll an 11 or higher after all ad-
justments were made (but the +1 bonus
would be added to her die roll, so that effec-
tively she needs to roll only a 10 on the die
to reach her saving throw number of 11).
High ability scores in Dexterity and Wis-
dom sometimes give saving throw bonuses.
A high Wisdom protects against illusions,
charms, and other mental attacks. Dexter-
ity, if high enough, can give a character a



1/ fl
/ - -
slightly higher chance of avoiding the effects
of fireballs, lightning bolts, crushing boul-
ders, and other attadts where nimbleness
may be a help. (See Tables 2 and 5.)
Magical items like cloaks and rings of
protection give bonuses to a character's sav-
ing throw (these are listed in the item
descriptions in the DMG).
Magical armor allows a saving throw
bonus only when the save is made necessary
by something physical, whether normal or
magical; magical armor never gives a saving
throw bonus against gas (which it Cannot
block). P0ison (which operates intemally),
and spells that are mental in nature or that
cause no physical damage.
For example, magical amior would not
help a character's saving throw against the
sting of a giant scorpion, the choking effects
of a stinking cloud spell, or the transforma-
tion effect of a polymorph others spell.
Magical armor does extend its protective
power to saving throws against acid sprays
or splashes, disintegration, magical and
normal fires, spells that cause damage, and
falls (if any saving throw is allowed in this
case). Other situations must be handled on a
case-by-case basis by the DM.
Specific spells and magical items have
effects, both good and ill, on a character's
saving throws. Often, spells force the victim
to save with a penalty, which makes even
the most innocuous spell quite dangerous.
(specific information can be found in the
spell descriptions, for spells, or in the
DMG's Magical Items section, for magical
items.)
Minor poisons of verminous creatures
such as giant centipedes, while dangerous,
are weak and unlikely to bring about death
in a healthy man. To recreate this effect in
the game, a saving throw bonus is allowed
for anyone affected by these poisons, The
DM has this infon-nation.
Unpredictable situations are sure to crop
up. When this happens, the DM must deter-
mine whether saving throw modifiers are
appropriate. As a guideline, modifiers for
situations should range from -4 to +4. An
evil cleric attacked in his shrine could very
well have a +3 bonus to all his saving
throws and a -3 penalty applied to those of
his enemies. The powerful evil of the place
could warrant the modiﬁer.
Magic Resistance »
Some creatures or
items strongly resist the effects of magic (or
impart such resistance to others). This
makes them more difficult to affect with
magical energy than ordinary creatures or
items.
A rare few creatures are extremely anti-
magical—magic rolls off them like water off
a duck's back. More common are creatures,
especially from the outer planes of exist-
Combat (Magic Resistance)
ence, that live in enchanted or sorcerous
lands and are filled with powerful magical
energies. These creatures eat and breathe
the vapors of wizardry, and they have a
high tolerance against arcane power.
Magic resistance is an innate ability—that
is, the possessor does not have to do any-
thing special to use it. The creature need not
even be aware of the threat for his magic
resistance to operate. Sudi resistance is part
of the creature or item and cannot be sepa-
rated from it. (Creatures, however, can vol-
untarily lower their magic resistance at
will.)
Magic resistance is also an individual
ability. A creature with magic resistance
cannot impart this power to others by hold-
ing their hands or standing in their midst.
Only the rarest of creatures and magical
items have the ability to bestow magic
resistance upon another.
Magic resistance is given as a percentile
number. For a magical effect to have any
chance of success, the magic resistance must
be overcome. The target (the one with the
magic resistance) rolls percentile dice. lf the
roll is higher than the creature's magic resist-
ance, the spell has a normal effect. If the roll
is equal to or less than the creature's magic
resistance, the spell has absolutely no effect
on the creature.
Effects of Magic Resistance
Magic resistance er\-
ables a creature to ignore the effects of spells
and spell-like powers. lt does not protect the
creature from magical weapon attacks or
from natural forces that may be a direct or
accidental result of a spell. Nor does it pre-
vent the protected creature from using his
own abilities or from casting spells and
using magical items. it can be effective
against both individually targeted spells
and, within lirru'ts, area-effect spells.
lf a magic resistance roll fails, and the
spell has normal effect, the target can make
all saving throws normally allowed against
the spell.
When Magic Resistance Applies
Magic resistance ap-
plies only if the successful casting of a spell
would directly affect the resistant creature
or item. Thus, magic resistance is effective
against magic missile (targeted at a creature
or item) or ﬁreball (damaging the area the
creature or item is in) spells.
Magic resistance is not effective against
an earthquake caused by a spell. While the
creature may suffer injury or death falling
into a chasm the spell opens under its feet,
the magical energy of the spell was directed
at the ground, not the creature. Magic
resistant creatures are not immune to events
that occur as the consequence of spells, only
I01
to the direct energy created or released by a
spell.
Player characters do not nonnally have
magic resistance (though they still get sav-
ing throws vs. magical spells and such); this
ability is reserved mainly for special mon-
8tETS.
Successful Magic Resistance Rolls
A successful magic
resistance check can have four different
results, depending on the nature of the spell
being resisted:
Individually Targeted Spells: By defini-
tion. these spells affect iust one creature,
and only the targeted creature rolls for mag-
ic resistance (if it has any). lf a spell of this
type is directed at several targets, each rolls
independently of the others. (An example of
this would be a hold person spell aimed at
four creatures, with each creature getting a
magic resistance roll, if they have magic
resistance.)
If the magic resistance roll is successful,
the spell has no effed on that creature. lf the
spell is targeted only at the creature, the
spell fails completely and disappears. if sev-
eral targets are involved, the spell may still
affect others who fail their magic resistance
roll.
Area-Effect Spells: These spells are not
targeted on a single creature, but on a point.
The spell's effect encompasses everything
within a set distance of that point. A suc-
cessful magic resistance check enables the
creature to igiore the effect of the spell.
However, the spell is not negated and still
applies to all others in the area of effect.
ln-Place Spells: These spells operate con-
tinuously in a particular place or on a par-
ticular creature, character, or item. Pro-
fecfion from evil is one example of this kind
of spell.
Magic resistance cornes into play only if a
creature or item finds himself (or itself) in
the place where the spell is in operation.
Even then, magic resistance may not come
into play—nothing happens if the spell isn't
of a type that affects the character. Thus, a
pm? water spell would not collapse simply
because a magic resistant creature walked
through the area. A protection from evil
spell, which could affect the creature, would
be susceptible to magic resistance.
lf the DM deten-nines that a magic resist-
ance roll is appropriate. and the roll suc-
ceeds, the in-place spell collapses (usually
with a dramatic thunderclap and puff of
smoke).
Permanent Spells: Magic resistance is
insufficient to destroy a permanent spell.
Instead. the spell is negated (within the same
guidelines given for in-place spells) for as
long as the magic resistant creature is in the
area of effect.
Thus, a magic-resistant creature might be



able to step through a permanent wall of
force as if it weren't there. However, the
wall would spring back into existence as
soon as the creature passed through (i.e., no
one else can pass through).
Turning Undead
One important.
and potentially life-saving, combat ability
available to priests and paladins is the abil-
ity to turn undead. This is a special power
granted by the character's deity. Druids cun-
nut tum undead: priests of specific mythoi
may be able to at the DM's option.
Through the priest or paladin, the deity
manifests a portion of its power. terrifying
evil, undead creatures or blasting them right
out of existence. However, since the power
must be channeled through a mortal vessel.
success is not always assured.
When encountering undead, a priest or
paladin can attempt to tum the creatures
(remember that the paladin turns undead as
if he was two levels lower—a 5th-level pala-
din uses the level 3 column in Table 61).
Only one attempt can be made per character
per encounter, but several different charac-
Combat (Turning Undead) /
To resolve a turning attempt, look on Ta-
ble 61. Cross-index the Hit Dice or type of
the undead with the level of the character
(two levels lower for a paladin). lf there is a
number listed, roll 1d2O. lf the number
rolled is equal to or greater than that listed,
the attempt is successful. lf the letter "T"
(for “turned") appears, the attempt is auto-
matically successful without a die roll. li the
letter "D" (for "dispel") is given, the tuming
utterly destroys the undead. A dash (-)
means that a priest or paladin of that level
cannot turn that type of u.ndead. A success-
ful turn or dispel affects 2d6 undead. If the
undead are u mixed group. the lowest Hit
Dice creatures are turned first.
Only one die is rolled regardless of the
number of undead the character is attempt-
ing to tum in a given round. The result is
read individually for each type of undead.
For example, Gorus, a 7th-level priest,
and his party are attacked by two skeletons
led by a wight and a spectre. The turning at-
tempt is made, resulting in a roll of 12.
Gon.is's player reads the table for all three
types of undead using the same roll—12—
for all three. The skeletons are destroyed (as
Gorus knew they would be). The wight is

ters can make attempts at the same time
(with the results determined individually).
Attempting to tum counts as an action,
requiring one round and occurring during
the character's tum in the initiative order
(thus the undead may get to act before the
character can tum them). The mere pres-
ence of the character is not enough—a touch
of drama from the character is important.
Speech and gestures are important, so the
character must have his hands free and be in
a position to speak. However, tuming is not
like spellcasting and is not interrupted if the
character is attacked during the attempt.
tumed (a 4 or better was needed) and flees.
The spectre, however, continues forward
undaunted (since a 16 was needed to turn
the spectre).
Tumed undead bound by the orders of
another (e.g., skeletons) simply retreat and
allow the character and those with him to
pass or complete their actions.
Free-willed undead attempt to flee the
area of the turning character, until out of his
sight. If unable to escape, they circle at a dis-
tance, no closer than ten feet to the charac-
ter. provided he continues to maintain his
turning (no further die rolls are needed).
I03
 
lf the character forces the free-willed un-
dead to come closer than ten feet (by presing
them into a comer, for example) the tum-
ing is broken and the undead attack nor-
mally.
Evil Prluts and Undead
Evil priests are nor-
mally considered to be in league with undead
creatures. or at least to share their aims and
goals. Thus, they have no ability to tum un-
dead. However, they can attempt to com-
mand these beings.
This is resolved in the same way as a tum-
ing attempt. Up to 12 undead can be com-
manded. A 'T" result means the undead
automatically obey the evil priest, while a "D"
means the undead become completely subser-
vient to the evil priest. They follow his com-
mands (to the best of their ability and
understanding) until turned, commanded, or
destroyed by another.
Evil priests also have the ability to affect
paladins, tuming them as if they were undead.
However, since the living spirit of a paladin is
far more difficult to quell and subvert, pala-
dins are vastly more difficult to turn.
An evil priest attempting to turn a paladin
does so as if the prist were three levels lower
than he actually is. Thus, a 7th-level evil priest
would turn paladins on the 4th-level column.
He would have only a slim chance of turning a
7th-level paladin (7 HD) and would not be
able to tum one of 8th level at all (using the
level of the paladin as the H'D to be tumed).
All "D" results against paladins are treated as
"T" results.
ln]ury and Death
Sometimes, no de-
gree of luck, skill, ability, or resistance to vari-
ous attacks can prevent harm from coming to
a character. The adventuring life carries with it
unavoidable risks. Sooner or later a C.l‘lﬂ!'3Cl8I‘
is going to be hurt.
To allow characters to be heroic (and for
ease of play). damage is handled abstractly in
the AD&D@ game. All characters and mon-
sters have a number of hit points. The more
hit points a creature has. the harder it
is to defeat.
Damage is subtracted from a character's
(or creatures) hit points. Should one of the
player characters hit an ogre in the side of
the head for 8 points of damage, those B
points are subtracted from the ogr-e's total
hit points. The damage isn't applied to the
head. or divided among different areas of
the body,
Hit point loss is cumulative until a character
dies or has a chance to heal his wounds.

age. Fifteen minutes Inter, Cwell nms into a

bugbear that inﬂicts 7points ofdamage, Cwell

This l0 points of damage remains until Cwell
heals, either naturally or through magical
means.
Wolmds
When a character
hits a monster, or vice versa, damage is suf-
fered by the victim. The amount of damage
depends on the weapon or method of attack.
ln Table 44 of Chapter 6, all weapons are rated
for the amount of damage they inflict to
Small, Medium, and large targets. This is
given as a die range (1d8, Zd6, etc.).
Each time a hit is scored, the appropriate
dice are rolled and the damage is subtracted
from the cun"ent hit points of the target. An
orc that attaclc. with a sword, for example.
causes damage according to the infomiation
given for the type of sword it uses. A troll
that bites once and rends with one of its
clawed hands causes zdo points of damage
with its bite and 1d4+4 points with its claw.
(The DM gets this infonnation from the
Monstrous Compendium.)
Sometimes damage is listed as a die range
along with a bonus of +1 or more. The
troll's claw attack. above, is a good exam-
ple. This bonus may be due to high
Strength, magical weapons, or the sheer fe-
rocity of the creature's attack. The bonus is
added to whatever number comes up on the
die roll, assuring that some minimum
amount of damage is caused. Likewise. pen-
alties can also be applied, but no successful
attack can result in less than 1 point of dam-
age.
Sometimes an attack has both a die roll
and a damage multiplier. The number rolled
on the dice is multiplied by the multiplier to
determine how much damage is inﬂicted.
This occurs mainly in backstabbing at-
tempts. In cases where damage is multi-
plied, only the base damage caused by the
weapon is multiplied. Bonuses due to
Strength or magic are not multiplied; they
are added after the rolled damage is multi-
plied.
Speclal Damage
Getting hit by wea-
pons or monsters isn't the only way a charac-
ter can get hurt. lndeed, the world is full of
dangers for poor, hapless player characters,
dangers the DM can occasionally spring on
them with glee. Some of the nastier forms of
damage are described below.
falling
Player characters
have a marvelous (and, to the DM, vastly
amusing) tendency to fall off things, gener-
allv from great heights and almost always
Combat (Special Damage)
onto hard surfaces. While the falling is
harmless, the abrupt stop at the end tends to
cause damage.
When a character falls, he suffers 1d6
points of damage for every 10 feet fallen, to
a maximum of 20d6 (which for game pur-
poses can be considered ten-ninal velocity).
This method is simple and it provides all
the realism necessary in the game. lt is not a
scientific calculation of the rate of accelera-
tion, exact terminal velocity, mass. impact
energy, etc. of the falling body.
The fact of the matter is that physical
laws may describe the exact motion of a
body as it falls through space, but relatively
little is known about the effects of impact.
The distance fallen is not the only determin-
ing factor in how badly a person is hurt.
Other factors may include elasticity of the
falling body and the ground, angle of im-
pact, shock wave through the falling body,
dumb luck, and more.
People have actually fallen from great
heights and survived, albeit very rarely. The
current record-holder, Vesna Vulovic, sur-
vived a fall from a height of 33,330 feet in
1972, although she was severely injured.
Flight-Sergeant Nicholas S. Alkemade actu-
ally fell 18,000 feet—almost 3.5 miles-
without a parachute and landed uninjured!
The point of all this is roll the dice. as de-
scribed above, and don't worry too much
about science.
Paralysis
A character or
creature affected by paralysis becomes to-
tally immobile for the duration of the spell's
effect. The victim can breathe, think. see,
and hear, but he is unable to speak or move
in any manner. Coherent thought needed to
trigger magical items or innate powers is
still possible.
Paralysis affects only the general motor
functions of the body and is not the ultimate
destroyer of powerful creatures. lt can be
particularly potent on flying creatures,
however.
An Example of Paralysis: The adventur-
ers encounter a beholder. a fearsome crea-
ture with magical powers that emanate from
its many eyes.
After several rounds of combat. the par-
ty's priest casts a hold monster spell, para-
lyzing the creature. The paralyzed beholder
can still use the spell-like powers of its eyes
and can still move about (since it levitates at
will). But, on the other hand, it is not able to
move its eyestalks to aim. Since all of its
eyes were most likely facing forward at the
moment of paralysis, the adventurers clev-
erly spread out in a ring around the crea-
ture. To attack one or two of them with its
powers, the beholder must turn its back on
the rest.
I04
Energy Draln
This is a feature of
powerful undead (and other particularly
nasty monsters). The energy drain is a par-
ticularly horrible power, since it causes the
loss of one or more experience levelsl
When a character is hit by an energy-
draining creature. he suffers normal damage
from the attack. ln addition, the character
loses one or more levels (and thus Hit Dice
and hit points). For each level lost, roll the
Hit Dice appropriate to the character’: class
and subtract that number of hit points from
the character's total (subtract the Constitu-
tion bonus also, if applicable). if the level(s)
lost was one in which the character received
a set number of hit points rather than a die
roll, subtract the appropriate number of hit
points. The adiusted hit point total is now
the character's maximum (i.e.. hit points
lost by energy drain are not taken as dam-
age but are lost permanently).
The character's experience points drop to
halfway between the minimum needed for
his new (post-drain) level and the minimum
needed for the next level above his new
level.
Multi-class and dual-class characters lose
their highest level first. If both levels are
equal. the one requiring the greater number
of experience points is lost first.
All powers and abilities gained by the
player character by virtue of his former
level are immediately lost. including spells.
The character rnust instantly forget any
spells that are in excess of those allowed for
his new level, ln addition, a wizard loses all
understanding of spells in his spell books
that are of higher level than he can now cast.
Upon regaining his previous level, the spell-
caster must make new rolls to see if he can
relearn a spell, regardless of whether he
knew it before.
lf a character is drained to Oth level but
still retains hit points (i.e.. he is still alive),
that character's adventuring career is over.
He cannot regain levels and has lost all ben-
efits of a character class. The adventurer has
become an ordinary person. A restoration
or wish spell can be used to allow the char-
acter to resume his adventuring career. If a
0th-level character suffers another energy
drain, he is slain instantly, regardless of the
number of hit points he has remaining.
lf the character is drained to less than 0
levels (thereby slain by the undead). he re-
turns as an undead of the same type as his
slayer in 2d4 days. The newly risen undead
has the same character class abilities it had
in normal life, but with only half the experi-
ence it had at the beginning of its encounter
with the undead who slew it.
The new undead is automatically an
NPCI His goals and ambitions are utterly
opposed to those he held before. He pos-
sesses great hatred and contempt for his



former colleagues, weaklings who failed
him in his time of need. Indeed, one of his
main ambitions may be to destroy his
former companions or cause them as much
grief as possible.
Furthermore, the newly undead NPC is
under the total control of the undead who
slew it. lf this master is slain, its undead
minions gain one level for each level they
drain from victims until they reach the max-
imum Hit Dice for their kind. Upon reach-
ing full Hit Dice, these undead are able to
acquire their own minions (by slaying char-
acters).
Appropriate actions on the part of the
other player characters can prevent a drained
comrade from becoming undead. The steps
necessary vary with each type of undead and
are explained in the monster descriptions in
the Monstrous Compendium.
Poison
This is an all-too fre-
quent hazard faced by player characters.
Bites, stings, deadly potions, drugged
wines, and bad food all await characters at
the hands of malevolent wizards, evil assas-
sins, hideous monsters, and incompetent
innkeepers. Spiders, snakes, centipedes.
scorpions, wyvems, and certain giant frog
all have poisons deadly to characters. Wise
PCs quickly leam to respect and fear such
creatures.
The strength of different poisons varies
wildly and is frequently overestimated. The
bite of the greatly feared black widow spi-
der lcills a victim in the United States only
once every other year. Only about 2% of all
rattlesnake bites prove fatal.
At the other extreme, there are natural
poisons of intense lethality. Fortunately,
such poisons tend to be exotic and rare—the
golden arrow-poison frog, the westem tai-
pan snake, and the stonefish all produce
highly deadly poisons.
Furthermore, the effect of a poison de-
pends on how it is delivered. Most fre-
quently, it must be injected into the
bloodstream by bite or sting. Other poisons
are only effective if swallowed; assassins fa-
vor these for docloring food. By far the
most deadly variety, however, is contact
poison, which need only touch the skin to
be effective.
Paralytic poisons leave the character un-
able to move for 2d6 hours. His body is
limp. making it difficult for others to move
him. The character suffers no other ill ef-
fects from the poison, but his condition can
lead to quite a few problems for his compan-
ions.
Debilitating poisons weaken the d'\arac-
ter for 1d3 days. All of the character's abil-
ity scores are reduced by half during this
time. All appropriate adjustments to attack
rolls, damage, Armor Class, etc., from the
lowered ability scores are applied during the
course of the illness. Furthermore, the char-
acter moves at one-half his normal move-
ment rate. Finally, the character cannot heal
by normal or magical means until the poi-
son is neutralized or the duration of the de-
bilitation is elapsed.
Treating Poison Victims
Fortunately, there are many ways a char-
acter can be treated for poison. Several
spells exist that either slow the onset time.
enabling the character the chance to get fur-
ther treatment. or negate the poison en-
tirely. However, cure spells (including heal)
do not negate the progress of a poison, and
neutralize poison doesn't recover hit points
already lost to the effects of poison. In addi-
tion, characters with herbalism proficiency
can take steps to reduce the danger poison
presents to player characters.
Heallng
Once a character is
wounded, his player will naturally want to
get him healed. Characters can heal either
by natural or magical means. Natural heal-
ing is slow, but it's available to all charac-
ters, regardless of class. Magical healing
may or may not be available, depending on
the presence (or absence) of spellcasters or
magical devices.
The only limit to the amount of damage a
character can recover through healing is the
total hit points the character has. A charac-
ter cannot exceed this limit until he gains a
new level, whereupon another Hit Die (or a
set number of points) is added to his total.
Healing can never restore more hit points to
a character than his maximum hit point to-
tal.
Natural Healing
Characters heal nat-
urally at a rate of 1 hit point per day of rest.
Rest is defined as low activity--nothing
more strenuous than riding a horse or trav-
eling from one place to another. Fighting,
running in fear, lifting a heavy boulder, or
any other physical activity, prevents rest-
ing, since it strains old wounds and may
even reopen them.
If a character has complete bed rest (do-
ing nothing for an entire day), he can regain
3 hit points for the day. For each complete
week of bed rest, the character can add any
Constitution hit point bonus he might have
to the base of 21 points (3 points per day) he
regained during that week.
in both cases above, the character is as-
sumed to be getting adequate food, water,
and sleep. lf these are lacking, the character
does not regain any hit points that day.
I05
Maglcal Healing
Healing spells, po-
tions, and magical devices can speed the
process of healing considerably. The spe-
cifics of such magical healing methods are
described in the spell descriptions in this
book and in the DMG (for magical items).
By using these methods, wounds close in-
stantly and vigor is restored. The effects are
immediate.
Magical healing is particularly useful in
the midst of combat or in preparation for a
grievous encounter. Remember, however
that the characters‘ opponents are just as
likely to have access to magical healing as
the player characters—-an evil high priest is
likely to carry healing spells to bestow on
his own followers and guards. Healing is
not, of itself, a good or evil act.
Remember that under no circumstances
can a character be healed to a point greater
than his original hit point total. For exam-
ple, say a character has 30 hit points, but
suffers 2 points of damage in a fight. A while
later, he takes an additional point of dam-
age. bringing his current hit point total to
27. A spellcaster couldn't restore more than
3 points to him, regardless of the healing
method used. Any excess points are lost.
Herbalism It Healing Proﬂclencles
Characters can also
gain minor healing benefits from those pro-
ficient in the arts of herbalism and healing.
These talents are explained in Chapter 5.
Character Death
When a character
reaches 0 hit points, that character is slain.
The character is immediately dead and un-
able to do anything unless some specialized
magical effect takes precedence.
Death from l'olson
Poison complicates
this situation, somewhat. A character who
dies as a result of poisoning may still have
active venom in his system.
Poisons remain effective for Zdé hours af-
ter the death of the victim. if the character is
raised during this time, some method must
be found to neutralize the poison before the
character is restored to life. lf this is not
done, then after the character rolls the res-
urrection survival check as given in "Raising
the Dead" on page 106 (and assuming the
roll is successful), he must immediately roll
a successful saving throw vs. poison or suf-
fer all the effects of the poison in his body, as
per the normal rules. This may only injure
some characters, but it may kill other char-
acters seconds after being raisedl



Death from Massive Damage
ln addition to dy-
ing when hit points reach 0, a character also
runs the risk of dying abruptly when he suf-
fers massive amounts of damage. A charac-
ter who suffers S0 or more points of damage
from a single attack must roll a successful
saving throw vs. death, or he dies.
This applies only if the damage was done
by a single attack. Multiple attacks totaling
S0 points in a single round don't require a
saving throw.
For example, a Character would be required
to make a dieck if a dragon breathed on him
for 72 points of damage. He wouldn't have to
do so if eight orcs hit him for a total of S3
points of damage in that round.
lf the saving throw is successful, the char-
acter remains alive (unless of course the 50-
hit-point loss reduced his hit points to O or
belowl). If the saving throw fails, the char-
acter immediately dies from the intense
shock his body has taken. His hit points are
reduced to 0.
The character may still be raised in the
normal ways, however.
inescapable Death
There are occasions
when death is unavoidable, no matter how
many hit points a character has.
A character could be locked in a room
with no exits, with a SO-ton ceiling descend-
ing to cmsh him. He could be trapped in an
escape-proof box filled completely with
acid. These examples are extreme (and ex-
tremely grisly), but they could happen in a
fantasy world.
Ralslng the Dead
Curative and heal-
ing spells have no effect on a dead
character—he can only be retumed to life
with a raise dead or resurrection spell (or a
device that accomplishes one of these ef-
fects). Each time a character is returned to
life. the player must make a resurrection
survival roll based on his current Constitu-
tion (see Table 3). lf the die roll is successful
(Let. the player rolls equal to or less than his
resurrection survival percentage), the char-
acter is restored to life in whatever condi-
tion is specified by the spell or device.
A character restored to life in this way has
his Constitution permanently lowered by 1
point. This can affect hit points previously
eamed. Should the character's Constitution
bonus go down. the character's hit point to-
tal is reduced by the appropriate number of
hit points (the amount of hit point bonus
lost is multiplied by the number of levels for
which the character gained extra hit points
from that bonus). When the character's
Constitution drops to 0, that character can
no longer be raised. He is permanently re-
moved from play.

Hidden out there in the campaign world are
great treasures awaiting discovery. Ancient
dragons rest on huge hordes of gold, silver,
and gems. Orc chieftains greedily gamer the
loot from the latest raid. Mindless jellies
ooze through the bones and armor of unfor-
tunate souls. Foul lords of darkness cun-
ningly leave small fortunes apparently
unguarded, like spiders luring in the flies.
Stooped wizards assemble shelves of arcane
magical items. Some treasures, like those of
dragons, are gathered and horded for rea-
sons fully understood only by their collec-
tors. Others are gathered for more mundane
purposes—power, luxury. and security. A
rare few troves date from eons before, their
owners long dead and forgotten. Some trea-
sure hordes are small, such as the pickings
of a yellow mold. Others are enormous,
such as the Tyrant King's treasury. Trea-
sures may be free for the taking or fiercely
trapped and watched over.
Treasure Types
Treasure comes in
many different forms and sizes, ranging
from the mundane to the exotic. There are
of course coins of copper, silver, gold, elec-
tnrm, and platinum. But precious metals
can also be shaped into gilded mps, etched
bowls, or even silverware. Characters know
the value of coins and will have no difficulty
establishing their worth in most cases. How-
ever, ancient treasure hordes may contain
coins no longer used. It may be that these
can be sold only by their weight. Objects
made of valuable metal are even more diffi-
cult to appraise. Either the characters must
find a goldsmith who can value the item and
a buyer willing to pay a fair price, or these
too must be melted down for their metal. ln
large cities this is not too difficult. There are
always appraisers and fences handy,
although getting full value might be diffi-
cult. (Accusations of theft are another small
problem.) Characters must be aware of
cheats and counterfeiters though. An appar-
ently valuable bowl could actually be base
metal plated in silver. The metal of coins
could be debased with copper or brass.
Weights could be rigged to give false prices.
Characters must find merchants they can
trust.
Gems are another common form of trea-
sure and here player characters are even
more dependent on others. Unless the party
has a skilled appraiser of precious stones,
they're going to have to trust others. After
all, those red stones they found in the last
treasure could be cheap glass, richly colored
but only marginally valuable quartz, semi-
precious gamets, or valuable rubies. Again,
the player characters are going to have to
find a jeweler they can trust and be watchful
for cheats and scams. However, truly tricky
DMs might present your characters with
Chapter |o= Treasure
uncut gems. These are almost impossible for
the untrained eye to spot or appraise. Most
characters (and most players) are not going
to realize that a piece of unremarkable stone
can be a valuable gem when properly cut.
Perhaps the most difficult of all treasure
items to appraise are objects of artistic val-
ue. While gems cut or uncut are valuable,
their worth can be greatly increased when
used in a piece of jewelry. Gold is valuable
by weight, but even more so when fash-
ioned into a cup or pin. Dwarven craftsmen
from hidden communities practice the finest
arts of gem-cutting, while gnomish artisans
in earthen burrows labor away on elaborate
gold and silver filigrees. Ancient elven carv-
ings, done in exquisitely grained woods,
stand side by side with the purest of statues
chiseled by man. All of these have a value
that goes far beyond their mere materials.
But artistic creations seldom have a fixed
value. Their price depends on the player
characters finding a buyer and that person's
willingness to buy. A few large cities may
have brokers in arts, merchants who know
the right people and are willing to act as go-
betweens. Most of the time, however, the
player characters have to go to the effort of
peddling their wares personally. This
requires tact and delicacy, for such items are
seldom bought by any but the wealthy and
the wealthy often do not like stooping to
business negotiations. Player characters
must carefully avoid giving insult to the
barons, dukes, counts, and princes they
might deal with.
Finally, there are the truly unusual things
your character can find—furs, exotic ani-
mals, spices, rare spell components, or even
trade goods. As with art objects, the values
of these items are highly subjective. First the
player characters have to find a buyer. This
is not too difficult for everyday things, such
as furs or trade goods, but it can be a tre-
mendous enterprise if you have a spell com-
ponent that is useful only to the most
powerful of wizards. Next the PCs must
haggle about the price. Furriers and mer-
chants do this as a matter of course. Others
haggle because they hope the PCs do not
know the tnre value of what they hold or
because they themselves do not know. After
all this, the PCs might be able to sell their
goods. However, if you enter into this in the
true spirit of role-playing and see it as part
of the adventure, the whole process is
enjoyable.
Magical Items
The treasures meri-
tioned thus far are all monetary. Their use-
fulness is immediate and obvious. They g've
characters wealth, and with wealth comes
power and inﬂuence. However, there are
other treasures, very desirable ones, that
your characters will not want to sell or give
I01
( \ -.
away. These are the magical items that your
characters find and use.
Although priests and wizards can make
magical items (according to the guidelines
your DM has for magical research), it is far
more common for characters to find these
items during the course of adventures. Mag-
ical items are powerful aids for diaracters.
With them, characters can gain bonuses in
combat, cast spells with the mere utterance
of a word, withstand the fiercest fire. and
perform feats impossible by any other
known means. Not all magical items are
beneficial, however. Some are cursed, the
result of faulty magical construction or,
very rarely, the deliberate handiwork of
some tnily mad or evil wizard.
A very few magical items are artifacts—-
items created by beings more powerful than
the greatest player characters. These are
perilously dangerous items to use. There are
only three methods to determine how to use
artifacts—du.mb lud<, trial and error, and
diligent researdm.
There are many different magical items
your character can find, but they all fall into
a few basic categories. Each type of magical
item has properties you should be aware of.
Magical Weapons: There can be a magi-
cal version of nearly any type of normal
weapon, although there are admittedly few
magical bardiches or guisarrne-voulges. By
far the most common magical weapons are
swords and daggers. A magical weapon typ-
ically gives a +1 or greater bonus to attack
rolls, increasing a character's chance to hit
and cause damage. Perhaps magical swords
are quicker on the attack, or maybe they're
sharper than normal steel—the explanation
can be whatever the DM desires. Whatever
the reason, magical weapons give results far
beyond those of even the finest-crafted non-
magical blade.
A rare few weapons have even greater
powers. These may allow your character to
sense danger, heal wounds, float in mid—air,
or have the most amazing luck. The rarest
of the rare can actually communicate with
your character and are imbued with an
other-worldly intelligence. While the most
powerful of magical weapons, these clever
instruments of destruction sometimes seek
to impose their wills on their owners.
When you find a magical weapon, more
than likely you do not know its properties.
Some functions, such as the advantage it
gives you in combat, can be learned by trial
and error. Other properties must be learned
through research and spells. Ancient histo-
ries and legend lore spells can provide infor-
mation on the properties of your weapon.
On rare occasions, properties are discov-
ered through blind luck. Simply command-
ing the weapon to activate one power after
another (hoping it will suddenly spring to
life) works only for the most minor
abilities—detecting danger, spotting seuet

r
in
doors, or locating treasure. Greater abilities
require that specific commands be uttered,
perhaps in long-forgotten languages.
Magical Armor: Enchanted armors are
the complements to magical weapons.
These annors have a *1 or better bonus to
their normal Armor Class, being made of
stuff stronger and finer than nonmagical
armor. Furthennore, these annors grant
some measure of protection against attacks
that normal amiors would not stop. Chain
mail +1, for instance, improves the charac-
ter's saving throw against the fiery breath of
a dragon by 1, thus providing more than
just a physical shield. in rare instances,
armor may possess extraordinary powers.
Although such armors are generally finely
made and elaborately engraved, characters
can discover the armors’ powers only by the
same methods they use to discover the
powers of magical weapons.
Potions and Oils: Magical potions and
oils are easily found but hard to identify.
They come in small bottles, jugs, pots, or
vials and clearly radiate magic if a detection
spell is used. However, the effect of any
potion is unknown until some brave soul
tries a small sample. The results can be quite
varied. The imbiber may discover he can
ﬂoat or fly, resist great heat or cold, heal
grievous wounds, or fearlessly face the
greatest dangers. He may also find himself
hopelessly smitten by the first creature he
y
\
sees or struck dead by a powerful poison. lt
is a risk that must be taken to leam the
nature of the potion.
Scrolls: Scrolls are a convenience and lux-
ury for spellcasters. By reading the incanta-
tion written on the pages, the priest or
wizard can instantly cast that spell. He does
not need to memorize it, have the material
components handy, or do any of the things
normal spellcasting requires. Experienced
and powerful wizards normally spend their
evenings preparing such scrolls for their
own adventuring use.
Some scrolls are usable by all characters,
granting special but temporary protections
from various dangers—evil creatures, were-
wolves, powerful beings from other planes,
etc. Other scrolls bear hideous or humorous
curses, brought into effect at the mere read-
ing of their titles. Unfortunately, the only
way to know what a scroll contains is to
silently scan its contents. For scrolls con-
taining wizard spells, this requires the use of
a read magic spell. Other scrolls can be read
by all. This scan does not cast the spell writ-
ten on the scroll, but it tells the character
what is written there (and exposes him to
the effects of curses). Once the scroll is read,
it can be used at any time in the future by
that character.
Rings: Magical rings are usable by many
different classes and bestow a wide range of
powers, from pyrotechnic displays to wish-
I08
es. While the aura of a magical ring can be
detected, its properties cannot be discov-
ered until it is wom and the command word
is uttered. (The command word is most
commonly found inscribed on the inside of
the band.) As with all magical items. some
rings can harm your character. Worse still,
cursed rings can be removed only with the
aid of spells!
Wands, Staves, and Rods: These are
among the most powerful of standard magpi-
cal items. Wands are commonly used by
wizards, allowing them to cast powerful
spells with the ﬂick of a wrist. Staves can be
used by either a wizard or a priest. Staves
can be truly destructive, dwarfing even the
potential of a wand. Rods are the rarest of
all, the accoutennents of witch-kings and
great lords. With rods come dominance and
power.
Fortunately for your character, few of
these items are cursed or dangerous to han-
dle. But all must be operated by a command
word-—a specific word or phrase that trig-
gers the power within. No wand, stave, or
rod shows any indication of its powers by
mere sight or handling. Careful research
and probing are most often needed to tap
the potential stored within.
Wands, staves, and rods are not limitless
in their power. Each use drains them slight-
ly, using up a charge. There is no power
gauge or meter showing what is left. A char-
3
/



acter discovers his wand is drained only
when it no longer functions or suddenly
crumbles into useless dust.
Miscellaneous Magic: Miscellaneous
magical item are where the true variety of
magical treasures lies. Each item possesses
some unique power. There are horseshoes to
make your horse go faster, brooms to ride.
sadts that hold more than they should.
paints that create real thinp, girdles that
grant great strength, caps to make your
character smarter, books that increase abili-
ty scores, and much, much more. Each item
is different and not all can be identiﬁed in
the sarne way. The effects of some become
obvious the instant the item is handled,
donned, or opened. Others require research
and questioning to learn the command word
needed to activate them. All are quite valu-
able and rare.
Artifacts and Relics: Finally, there are
artifacts and relics. Don't count on your PC
ever finding one of these rarest of all magi-
cal items. Even if your character does find
one, think carefully before you decide to let
him keep it permanently. Artifacts are the
most powerful magical items in the game.
indeed, many are powerful enough to alter
the course of historyl They are all unique
and have unique histories. You can never
find more than one Hand of Verna in a
world. Because it is so unique, each artifact
has special and significant powers. Artifacts
never appear by accident; they are always
placed by the DM.
Finding artifacts is always the result of a
very special adventure. Your DM has placed
that artifact for a reason. lt is not likely that
he really intends for your characters to keep
it. Instead, he has something arranged in
which you need that artifact for a specific
purpose. The problem with keeping arti-
facts is that they are too powerful. Not only
do they unbalance your character in the
short run, they also eventually corrupt and
destroy him. The magical power of artifacts
is such that they destroy their owners soon-
er or later. There is a price to be paid for
power, and it is not a cheap one.
Dividing and
Storing Treasure
Once your group
completes a successful adventure, it is
almost certain to have collected some trea-
sure. Therefore, it helps to have some prear-
ranged agreement about how this treasure is
to be divided among the different player
characters and their henchmen. This is a
true role-playing decision that must be
reached among all the players at the table.
There are no rules about how your charac-
ters should divide treasures.
However, there are some suggested meth-
ods and reasons to make or not make some
/ s.
Treasure (Dividing and Storing) 7
agreements. If you bear these in mind, you
will have fewer arguments and bad feelings
between the different players and their char-
acters in your group.
Cash treasure is the easiest. The most
direct and simplest method is equal shares
for all player characters and full or half
shares for all henchmen. A player may
argue that his character's contribution was
greater than that of other characters, but
these things average out in the long run.
Besides, that player has no real idea of the
contribution of others. A character who
guarded the rear may have discouraged hid-
den opponents from springing an ambush
on the group, something that only the DM
knows.
Additional considerations include ex-
traordinary costs. Some adventuring
groups establish a special fund to pay the
costs (if there are any) of healing, resurrect-
ing, or restoring fellow player characters.
Again this works on the principle that all
faced the danger and therefore all should
share equally in the expenses. Other groups
make allowances for differing character
levels (higher level characters assurnedly
shouldered more of the burden of the
adventure, and so should be rewarded pro-
portionately.) Some parties give special
rewards to those who took greater chances
or saved others. These encourage everyone
in the group to take part.
Magical treasure is more difficult to
divide up, since there is rarely enough to
give a useful item to every character, nor are
all items of equal value or power. Here you
must rely more on your sense of fairness if
you wish to maintain party harmony. Since
magical items are worthwhile to a party
only if they can be used, your first concern
should normally be to get the right item into
the right hands. A magical sword in the pos-
session of a wizard is not nearly as useful as
it would be in the hands of a fighter. Like-
wise, a wand does a ﬁghter little good but
could be a potent addition to a wizard.
Therefore it is a good idea to match items to
characters.
Alternatively, your party could deter-
mine the price an item would sell for, and
then make it available to any PC who is
willing to give the rest of the party that
amount of money. lf more than one player is
willing to pay the price, the interested play-
ers could roll dice to see who gets the item.
Or, for items that several characters could
all use equally well (such as a potion of heal-
ing that is useful to all), the characters can
bargain with each other and roll dice for
choices. A player character may relinquish
a claim on one magical item in exchange for
another. A character who has already
received a magical item may not be allowed
another choice if there are not enough pieces
to go around. lf no other agreement can be
readied, the players can roll dice and have
I09
, .

their characters pick in descending order. It
is a fair method (since people cannot right-
fully complain about a random roll), but it
can create imbalances. One or two charac-
ters could wind up with the bulk of the mag-
ical items over the course of several
adventures. At this point, they would be
wise to voluntarily withdraw from the selec-
tion process.
There are tactical issues to think about
when distributing treasure. lt is simply not
wise for one or two characters to carry the
bulk of the party's magical items. Successful
adventurers spread their gear throughout
their party. (This holds true even for explor-
ers and special forces in the real world.) This
way, if one character falls off the cliff and
disappears forever or is spirited away by an
invisible stalker, the party has not lost ev-
erything. To illustrate another consider-
ation, you are better off to have the ﬁghters,
thieves, and mages carry the healing potions
rather than let the cleric do it, since he has
healing spells. lf he ha both the healing
spells and the potions and should disappear
into the mist, your party has lost all its heal-
ing ability. lf it is spread around through the
group, at worst you might lose the potions
or the spells, but not both (unless disaster
really strikes, in which case there is no way
to prevent it anyway). In the end, you will
find that it does not pay to be too greedy.
Once your characters have assembled a
sizeable amount of treasure, they have to
find some place to keep it. lf your DM is
running a fairly medieval campaign, one
thing PCs are not going to find is a bank like
today's. lnstead, your characters must find
other ways to keep their money secure.
Chests with strong locks are a good start,
but there are still better methods. One
choice is to make the treasure small enough
that you can carry it with you at all times.
(Of course, one good mugging and you're
broke.) There is also the difficulty of buying
a drink with a 1,000-gp gem. A second
choice is to place your money in the hands
of someone you think you can trust. We all
know what the risks are there. You could
have your character give his fortune to a
local lord or church and then hope to call in
favors at a future date. This is not quite as
foolish as it sounds. lf the beneficiary of
your largess refuses to honor your agree-
ment, you'll never give him money again
and neither will anyone else, most likely. If
no one gives him any money, where will he
find the funds to support his llfe—style'l No,
such a person must seriously try to honor
his commitments. Of course. he may not do
as much as you would like. The best solu-
tion is that used throughout history—buy
goods and chattels. Land, livestock, and
trade goods are harder to steal and harder to
lose. If you must keep a large fortune, it is
best to keep it in something that can be car-
ried easily and is unlikely to be stolen.

Whenever a player character meets an NPC
(non-player character). fights a monster, or
even discovers a mysterious fountain in the
woods, he is having an encounter. An
encounter is any significant thing a charac-
ter meets, sees, or interacts with during the
course of a game. When a player character
discovers the fountain of blue flame in the
midst of the forest, its very strangeness
forces the character to react and the player
to think. Why is it here‘! Does it have a pur-
pose? ls it beneficial or dangerous? Few
characters are going to pass this by as just
another ﬂaming fountain in the forest.
Encounters are vital to the AD&D@ game,
for without them nothing can really happen
to the player character. An adventure with-
out encounters is like sitting in a room all
day with no one to talk to and little to look
at. It certainly wouldn't be very exciting.
And who wants to play an unexciting role-
playing game? Encounters provide danger,
risk, mystery, infonnation, intrigue, sus-
pense, humor, and more.
For an encounter to provide excitement, it
must also have an element of danger. A
good deal of this comes from the fact that
player characters don't know how the
encountered beings will react to them. Your
DM is not going to say, "You meet a group of
peasants and they are friendly.’ ' (If he does
say this, you ought to be suspicious.)
lnstead, he will say something like, "As you
ride around the bend, you come upon an ox-
cart lumbering down the road. A young
man in rough dothes is leading the cart.
Peering over the sides are a woman and sev-
eral dirty children. When the man sees you
he nods, smiles, and says,'Hail, strangers.
Have you news of Thomhampton-on-the-
Hill?' " You can probably guess they are
peasants and they seem friendly, but your
DM didn't come out and said so. Not know-
ing for sure is what keeps you on your toes.
They could be anything!
When your character travels or explores a
dungeon, your DM will have prepared two
general types of encounters. The first are
speciﬁc (planned) encounters. These are
meetings. events, or things the DM has cho-
sen to place in the adventure to build on the
story of the adventure.
For example, upon sneaking into the bug-
bear stronghold, your characters find a
squalid cell filled with humans and elves.
Your DM has placed them here for your
character to rescue. Of course, he could also
be playing a trick and the prisoners could
actually be evil dopplegangers (creatures
able to change their appearances at will).
Later. while in the hallway, your group
bumps into a bugbear patrol. This is the sec-
ond type of encounter, a random encounter,
also called a wandering encounter. ln this
case, your DM has made die rolls to see if
you come upon something and, if so, just
what that something is.
Chapter I I = Encounters I
Speciﬁc encounters generally have more
choices of action—your DM may want you
to discover some important information or
set up a particularly difficult battle. Specific
encounters usually yield greater treasures
and more magical items. Creatures may be
placed by the DM to guard the armory or
prevent the characters from reaching the
throne room.
Random encounters normally involve
simple choices—run away, fight, or ignore.
Sometimes characters can talk to creatures
in random encounters and leam valuable
information, but not often. Random
encounters also tend to have little or no
treasure. A patrol of city guardsmen does
not can'y as many valuable items on its
rounds as it would have in its barracks.
Random encounters are most often used to
weaken PCs, raise an unexpected alarm.
hurry them along, or lust make their lives
difficult.
Sometimes encounters are not with peo-
ple or monsters but with things. The foun-
tain in the forest is an encounter, but your
characters cannot fight it or talk to it (well,
maybe not). So what are you supposed to
do? In these cases, the encounter is more of a
puzzle. You have to figure out why this
fountain is here, what it can do, and if it is
important to your adventure. lt may be a
red herring—something placed there just to
confuse you; it may be a set up for a future
adventure—later on your characters may
learn that the flaming fountain they saw is
important to their latest mission. lt may be a
deadly trap. To find out, though, you will
have to deal with the thing in some way. You
could throw stones into the pool, drink the
glowing water, try to walk through the
ﬂames, or use spells to leam more. By doing
these things, you may get more infonnation
from your DM. Of course, you may not like
the answer! ("You drank the water? Oh,
dear. Tsk, tsk, tsk.")
The Surprlse Roll
Sometimes an en-
counter, either random or planned by the
DM, catches one of the two groups involved
totally off guard. This is called surprise and
is determined by rolling 1d10 for each side
(or only one side if the DM has decided that
one of the sides cannot be surprised, for
some reason). lf the die roll is a 1, 2, or 3.
that group or character is surprised (for
effects, see the "Effects of Surprise" section).
Naturally, surprise does not happen all the
time. There are many easy and intelligent
ways it can be prevented. The most obvious
is if the player characters can see those they
are about to encounter well before getting
close. For example the characters may see
the dust of a group of horsemen coming
their way, or notice the lantems of a group
of peasants coming through the woods, or
hear the grunting barks of a gnoll war party
dosing through the trees. ln these cases
there is no way the characters are going to
be surprised by the encounter. But if a leop-
ard leaped upon one of the group while he
was intently watching the approaching
riders, or if a group of goblins suddenly
sprang from the darkness, then the charac-
ters would have to roll to see if they were
stuprised. They were unprepared for these
threats and so could be taken off guard.
The DM decides when a check for sur-
prise must be made. He can require that one
roll be made for the entire party, that a sepa-
rate check be made for each character, or
that only specific characters check. This
depends entirely upon the situation.
For example, the entire party is intently
watching the band of approaching riders.
Then a leopard leaps from the branches of a
tree overhead. The DM knows that no one
in the group was particularly paying atten-
tion to the treetops, so he has one person in
the group roll the surprise die for the entire
party. The roll is a Z, the PCs are surprised,
the leopard gets a free round of attacks, and
there is mass confusion as the clawing, bit-
ing creature lands in their rnidstl lf two of
the characters had been on a general watch,
the DM could have had these characters roll
for surprise instead of the entire group. lf
both were surprised, the entire group would
have been unprepared for the leopai-d's
attack. Otherwise, one or both of the
guards might have noticed the creature
before it pounced. Experienced player char-
acters quickly learn the value of having
someone on watch at all times.
The surprise roll can also be modified by
Dexterity, race, class, cleverness, and situa-
tion. The DM has the listing of modifiers
that apply to given situations. Modifiers can
affect either your character's chance of
being surprised or his chance of surprising
others. A plus to your die roll reduces the
odds that you are surprised; a minus
increases those odds. Likewise, a minus to
the enemy's die roll means that the modiﬁer
is in your favor, while a plus means that
things are going his way. High Dexterity
characters are virtually unsurpriseable,
caught off guard only in unusual situations.
lt is important to bear in mind that sur-
prise and ambush are two different things.
Surprise works as explained above. An
ambush is prepared by one group to make
an unexpected attack on another group and
works only if the DM decides the other
group cannot detect the ambush. A proper-
ly set ambush gives the attackers the oppor-
tunity to use spells and normal attacks
before the other side reacts. lf the ambush
succeeds, the ambushing group gets its ini-
tial attack and the other group must roll for
surprise in the next round, so the ambushing
group may get two rounds of attacks before
the other group can reply.



' Encounters (Distance)
Effects of Surprise
Characters and mon-
sters that are surprised all suffer the same
penalty. They are caught off guard and thus
cannot react quickly. The surprising group
receives one round of attacks with melee.
missile, or magical items. They cannot use
these moments of surprise to cast spells.
A ranger on the unsurprised side could
fire his long bow twice (two attacks per
round) before his opponents could even
hope to react. A fighter able to attack twice
per round could attempt both hits before
any initiative dice are rolled. A mage could
unleash a bolt from his wand of lightning
before the enemy knew he was there. Of
course, what applies to player characters
also applies to monsters, so that the leopard
in the earlier example could claw and bite
before the characters even knew what was
happening.
The second effect of surprise is that the
surprised characters lose all AC bonuses for
high Dexterity during that instant of sur-
prise. The surprised characters are dumb-
founded by the attack. lnstead of ducking
and countering, they're just standing there
rather ﬂat-footed (maybe even with dumb
expressions on their faces). Since they don't
grasp the situation, they cannot avoid the
hazards and dangers very well.
Surprise can also be used to avoid an
encounter. Unsurprised characters can
attempt to ﬂee from a surprised group
before the other group reacts. Of course,
this is not always successful, since escape is
greatly dependent upon the movement rates
of the different creatures.
If both groups manage to surprise each
other, the effects of surprise are cancelled.
For example, Rath runs around the corner
straight into some lounging guardsmen.
Taken by surprise, he stops suddenly and
frantically looks for someplace else to run.
The guardsmen in turn look up rather stu-
pidly, trying to figure out why this dwarf
just raced around the corner. The surprise
passes. Rath spots another alley and the
guards decide that since he's running, Rath
must be a criminal. initiative rolls are now
made to see who acts first.
Encounter Distance
Once your charac-
ter or party has an encounter and it has been
determined whether or not anyone was sur-
prised, your DM will tell you the range of
the encounter—the distance separating you
from the other group. Many factors affect
encounter distance. These include the open-
ness of the terrain, the weather conditions,
whether surprise occurred, and the time of
day, to name a few. Although you do not
know the exact distance until your DM tells
you, surprise. darkness. or close terrain
(woods, city streets, or narrow dungeons)
usually results in shorter encounter dis-
tances, while open pound (deserts, plains,
or moors). good light, or advance warning
results in greater encounter distances (see
Chapter 13).
Encounter Options
Once an encounter
occurs, there is no set sequence for what
happens next. lt all depends on just what
your characters have encountered and what
they choose to do. That's the excitement of a
role-playing game-once you meet some-
thing, almost anything could happen. There
are some fairly common results of encoun-
ters, however.
Evulon: Sometimes all you want is for
your characters to avoid, escape, or other-
wise get away from whatever it is you've
met. Usually this is because you realize your
group is seriously outmatched. Perhaps
retuming badly hurt from an adventure,
your group spots a red dragon soaring over-
head. You know it can turn your party to
toast if it wants. Rather than take that risk,
your group hides, waiting for it to pass. Or,
topping a ridge, you see the army of
Frazmargth the lmpious, a noted warlord.
There are 5,000 of them and six of you.
Retreat seems like the better part of valor, so
you tum your horses and ride.
Sometimes you want to avoid an encoun-
ter simply because it will take too much
time. While riding with an urgent message
for his lord, your character rides into a
group of wandering pilgrims. Paying them
no mind, he lashes his horse and gallops
past.
Evading or avoiding an encounter is not
always successful. Some monsters pursue,
others do not. In the examples above,
Frazznargth the lmpious (being a prudent
commander) orders a mounted patrol to
chase the characters and bring them in for
questioning. The pilgrims, on the other
hand, shout a few oaths as your galloping
horse splashes mud on them and then con-
tinue on their way. Your character's success
at evading capture will depend on move-
ment rates, determination of pursuit, ter-
rain, and just a little luck. Sometimes when
he really should be caught, your character
gets lucky. At other times, well, he just has
to stand his ground.
Talk: Your character doesn't run from
encounters all the time, and attacking ev-
erything you meet eventually leads to prob-
lems. Sometimes the best thing to do is talk,
whether it's casual conversation, hardball
negotiation, jovial rumor-swapping, or
intimidating threats. ln fact, talking is often
better than fighting. To solve the problems
your DM has created for your character,
you need information. Asking the right
questions, developing contacts, and putting
Ill
out the word are all useful ways to use an
encounter. Not everything you meet,
human or otherwise, is out to kill your char-
acter. Help often appears in the most sur-
prising forms. Thus it often pays to take the
time to talk to creatures.
Fight: Of course. there are times when
you don't want to or can’! run away. (Run-
ning all the time is not that heroic.) And
there are times when you know talking is
not a good idea. Sooner or later, your char-
acter will have to fight. The real trick is
knowing when to ﬁght and when to talk or
run. If you attack every creature you meet,
the first thing that will happen is that
nobody will want to meet with your charac-
ter. Your character will also manage to kill
or chase off everyone who might want to
help him. Finally, sooner or later your DM
is going to get tired of this and send an
incredibly powerful youp of monsters after
your character. Given the fact that you've
been killing everything in sight, he's justified
in doing this.
So it is important always to know who
you are attacking and why. As with the best
police in the world today, the trick is to fig-
ure out who are the bad guys and who are
the good guys. Make mistakes and you pay.
You may kill an NPC who has a vital clue,
or unintentionally anger a baron far more
powerful than yourself. NPCs will be reluc-
tant to associate with your character, and
the law will find fewer and fewer reasons to
protect him. lt is always best to look on
combat as a last resort.
Wait: Sometimes when you encounter
another group, you don't know what you
should do. You don't want to attack them in
case they are friendly, but you don't want to
say anything to provoke them. What you
can do is wait and see how they react. Wait-
ing is a perfectly sensible option. However,
there is the risk that in waiting, you lose the
advantage should the other side suddenly
decide to attack. Waiting for a reaction so
that you can decide what to do causes a +1
penalty to the first initiative roll for your
group, if the other side attacks.
Of course, in any given encounter. there
may be many other options open to your
character. The only limit is your imag-
ination (and common sense). Charging a
band of orcs to break through their lines and
ﬂee may work. Talking them down with an
elaborate bluff about the army coming up
behind you might scare them off. Clever use
of spells could end the encounter in sudden
and unexpected ways. The point is, this is a
role-playing game and the options are as
varied as you wish to make them.

Player characters cannot fight, survive,
wheel, deal, plot, or scheme without inter-
acting with non-player characters (NPCs).
Indeed, the very heart of the AD&D° game
is the relationship between player charac-
ters and non—player characters. How the
player characters react to and treat NPCs
determines the type of game the group
plays. Although many choices are possible,
players quickly find that consideration and
good treatment of NPCs is the most fre-
quently successful route.
An NPC is any person, creature, or mon-
ster that is controlled by the DM. Most
NPCs are either people (intelligent races
that live in local society) or monsters (intel-
ligent and unintelligent creatures that aren't
normally found in tovms and villages). The
term "monster" is only a convenient label. lt
doesn't mean the creature is automatically
dangerous or hostile. Likewise, NPCs who
are people aren't uniformly helpful and
cooperative. As with all things, the range of
possible reactions of NPCs to PCs covers
the entire spectrum.
In the course of their adventures, player
characters will be most concemed with
three groups of NPCs; hirelings, followers,
and henchmen. lt is their aid that helps play-
er characters vanquish deadly monsters and
accomplish mighty deeds. As their names
imply, these NPCs can be persuaded in vari-
ous ways to join the player characters in
their adventures. The most common meth-
ods of persuasion are money and loyalty.
Hlrellngs
The most frequent-
ly employed NPC is the hireling. A hireling
is a person who works for money. Most
hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while
others are masters of a craft or art, and a
few are experts of specialized adventuring
skills. Typical hirelings include the follow-
ing:
Archer Architect
Armorer Assassin
Baker Blaclsmith
Bladesmith Foot Soldier
Jeweler Laborer
Messenger Minstrel
Sage Sailor
Spy Thief
Hirelings are always employed for a
stated term of service or for the perform-
ance of a spedfic task. Thus a mercenary
contracts to serve for a season. A thief can
be hired to steal a named item. A sage works
to answer a single question. A blacksmith
may indenture himself for a ten-n of years. A
sailor works for a single voyage. Quite
often these contracts can be renewed with-
out difficulty, but the only thing that binds a
hireling to the player character is regular
pay and good treatment. Hirelings do not
serve a PC out of any great loyalty.
Thus there are some things hirelings will
not do. Most hirelings do not foolishly risk
their lives. There are soldiers willing to take
their chances on the field of battle, but even
these courageous (or foolish) few do not
willingly undertake the greater hazards of
adventuring. They man castle walls, guard
caravans, collect taxes, and charge the
massed foe well enough. but they often
refuse to accompany a PC on an adventure.
Even a hireling who regularly undertakes
dangerous missions (a thief or an assassin,
for example) normally refuses to ioin player
character parties. These hirelings are loners.
They contract to do a job and get it done in
their ow-n way, without interference from
anyone else.
Hirelings are no more loyal than human
nature allows. For the most part, if paid and
treated well, with opportunities to realize
their ambitions, working for a charismatic
leader, hirelings can be relied on to do their
iobs faithfully. But poor pay, injustice, dis-
crimination, threats, abuse. and humilia-
tion at the hands of their masters make them
somewhat less than reliable. A smart leader
sees to the comfort and morale of his men
before his own concems. With less savory
c.haracters—those hired to perform dark
deeds—the player character takes even
greater chances, especially given the ques-
tionable morals of such characters.
Whatever their personalities, hirelings
generally need to make morale checks
(explained in the DMG) whenever they are
faced with a particularly dangerous situa-
tion or are offered a bribe or other tempta-
tion.
Finding hirelings is not difficult. People
need iobs. It is simply a matter of advertis-
ing. Under normal circumstances, appli-
cants respond to ads. Only when trying to
employ vast numbers or hire those with
unusual specialties (such as spies) does the
process become complicated. lust what

needs to be done in this situation depends
entirely upon the DM's campaign. Your
character may have to skulk through the
unsavory bats of the waterfront, rely on
questionable go-betweens, or pay a visit to
the thieves’ guild (if there is one). Iust
employing one of these characters can be a
small adventure in itself.
Employment costs of hirelings vary from
a few gold pieces a month to thousands of
gold pieces for an especially dangerous task.
The skill and experience of a hireling has a
great effect on his salary. A learned sage
researching some obscure piece of lore can
charge hefty sums. Costs can also be affect-
ed by the conditions of the campaign--the
setting, the recent events of the world, and
the reputations of the player characters (if
any). Most hirelings sign on for what they
think is fair. While few will tum down more
money, most will drive the best bargain they
can. Your DM has more information about
employment costs, since he may need to
alter these to fit his campaign.
Followers
More reliable than
those who are motivated purely by money
are those characters who, while they expect
pay. were originally drawn into service by
the reputation of the player character. These
are followers, usually a unit of soldiers of
one type or another. Followers serve only
those of significant power and reputation.
thus the construction of a stronghold is nec-
essary to attract followers.
Followers have the same needs and limita-
tions of ltirelings. Most must be paid and
well-treated. They also do not accompany
the player characters on group adventures.
They have some advantages over hirelings.
however. Followers do not serve for a spe-
cific tenn of contract. They remain with the
player character as long as their basic needs
are met. They are more loyal than the aver-
age hireling and are treated as elite troops.
Unlike most hirelings, followers can
increase in level (although this occurs very
slowly since they act only as soldiers). All
followers in a unit advance to the next level
at the same time. Finally, the player charac-
ter need not seek out followers-they come
to him, seeking positions within his illustri-
ous household.
Followers appear only once. Replace-
ments do not arrive to fill the ranks of the
fallen. (Massive losses of followers in com-
bat only gives the character a bad reputa-
tion, discouraging others from flocking to
his banner.) Player characters should take
care of their followers, perhaps treating
them as an elite bodyguard.
Some Ch6l'3C!€i’S attract unique followers
such as animals or magical beings.
Although termed followers, these creatures
are more properly treated as henchmen in
terms of loyalty and what they will and will
not do. They do not count against the char-
acter's limit on henchmen, however, since
they are technically followers.
I-lenchmen
Henchman are much
that hirelings are not. They are adventurers
who serve out of loyalty. They are willing to
risk their lives for those they respect. They
are also hard to find.
Henchman are powerful allies to a player
character. Unlike hirelings, they have the
nerve and ability to become powerful
adventurers. Although they expect their
share of treasure. they do not usually join a
player character for money. They are
attracted to the PC because of his reputation
or other qualities he possesses. As such,
henchmen cannot be expected to flock to the
banner of a neophyte adventurer. He may
gain himself one or two companions, but
others come only when he has earned a
greater reputation, met more people, and
proven himself a true friend and ally to
these NPCs.
Henchmen can come from any source.
Most often they are at first mere hirelings or
followers who, through distinctive actions,
come to the attention of the player charac-
ter. Some may be higher level, more skilled
hirelings who develop a bond to the player
character through long employment. Oth-
ers may be followers who have sound
advice for the player character.
A henchman is always of lower level than
the PC. Should he ever equal or surpass the
PC's level, the henchman leaves forever; it is
time for him to try his luck in the real world.
in some ways, the player character is the
mentor and the henchman his student.
When the strident has learned as much as the
teacher, it is time for him to go out on his
own.
Henchmen are more than just loyal fol-
lowers; they are friends and allies. Natu-
rally they expect to be treated as such. They
have little need for those who do not trust
them or treat them coldly. Abusiveness or
taking advantage of the friendship quickly
ends the relationship. Just as players must
with their own friends, player characters
must be sensitive to the needs and feeling of
their henchmen. Furthermore, henchmen
attach themselves to a particular player
character, not a group of player characters.
Thus it is only under the direst of circum-
stances that a henchman accepts the orders
of another PC. Should his friend (the player
character) fall. the henchman sees to his
needs. He doesn't abandon him and con-
tinue on with the other player characters
unless this is clearly the only way to aid his
friend.
A PC's Charisma detennines the maxi-
mum number of henchmen he can have.
Nl’Cs (Followers)
This is a lifetime limit, not just a maximum
possible at any given time. ln a world where
the fallen can be restored to life, it is expect-
ed that a man would make this effort for his
dearest friends, both player characters and
henchmen. For example, Rupert the half-elf
has had seven henchmen, but all have fallen
for one reason or another. Rupert's Cha-
risma is 15, so with the death of his latat
henchman, no more come to join him.
(Word has obviously gotten around that
Rupert's friends tend to meet unpleasant
ends, and he doesn't even have the decency
to bring them back to lifel Even if he had
tried to raise his henchmen and failed.
Rupert would still be viewed as a jinx, bad
luck for those around him.)
Attracting a henchman is fairly difficult.
One cannot advertise for friends with any
great succss. They grow and develop from
other relationships. A henchman can be
found by placing trust in a skilled 
Heroic deeds (saving the life of an NFC) can
create a strong and instant bond. Love cer-
tainly can form this bond. The player and
the DM must trust their own judgment to
determine when an N'PC becomes a hench-
man. There is no clear line an NFC must
cross to make the transition from hireling to
henchman. lnstead, it is a slide from one sta-
tus to the other.
Once an NPC becomes a henchman, the
player gains a high degree of control over
the character. He should be responsible for
the record keeping for that character. lt is
almost, but not quite, like having a new PC
for the player. lf the DM allows it, the play-
er can have all information regarding the
abilities of the henchman, although the DM
may choose not to reveal this information.
The player is allowed to make nearly all
decisions for the NPC, but the DM can
overrule any action as being out of charac-
ter.
There are certain things henchmen do not
do. They do not give away or loan out mag-
ical items. They do not allow others free
access to their spell books. They do not tol-
erate spell use that questions their loyalty
(detect lie or know alignment cast upon
them). They do not accept less than their
due share. ln general, within these limits,
henchman do what is desired of them. The
DM can at any time dictate the actions of a
henchman, since the character is still an
NPC.
lf a PC is not attentive to the wishes and
needs of his henchmen, or if he abuses and
humiliates them, he can expect the worst.
This is the stuff mutinies and rebellions are
made of. Should an abusive player charac-
ter fall at the hands of a once-loyal hench-
man, he has only himself to blame.
On the other hand. not all henchmen are
paragons of loyalty. The player character
must always be aware that henchmen are
sometimes not what they seem. They can be

ning villain has posed as a true companion.
waiting his chance to strike or spy on his
friend.
Player Character
Obllgatlons
Whenever a player
character takes on a hireling, follower, or
henchman, he has committed himself to cer-
tain obligations and customs that surround
such agreements. Some of these are obvi-
ous, having been worked out between the
player character and the NPC in advance.
Usually the wage and term of service are set-
tled upon before any agreement is reached.
For hirelings and followers, this is a set
amount of money each day, week, or
month, or a fee for a specific task. Hench-
men commonly receive a portion (1/z a nor-
mal share) of all treasure and magic found
on adventures. A player character is nor-
mally expected to contribute a little more
from his own funds, however.
Other obligations of the player character
are varied. Some must always be consid-
ered, while others almost never come into
effect. A player character is expected to pro-
vide meals and boarding (unless the NPC
has a home nearby). This is the most com-
mon obligation and applies to NPCs of all
walks of life. For those engaged in more
dangerous pursuits, however, additional
concessions must be granted. Since horses
are expensive, player characters should be
ready to cover the cost of mounts lost in
combat or on campaign. It is unreasonable
to expect a mercenary to buy a new mount
from his meager savings. likewise, other
items of war craft—weapons and armor-
must be replaced by the player character.
All soldiers are expected to provide their
own equipment when they are first
employed, but the player character must
replace all losses. Certainly all player char-
acters are expected to pay the cost of special
transport—securing passage on ships and
arranging wagons for baggage. Of the grim-
mer duties, player characters are expected
to pay for a decent (though hardly lavish)
interment.
One of the more unusual obligations of a
player character is to ransom his men. This
is especially true of men lost during a cam-
paign. The greater number of soldiers lost in
a battle are not slain but captured. Common
practice of the medieval period was to offi-
cially ransom these prisoners for well-
established prices. A common yeoman
footman might ransom for Z gp, a minor
priest for 80 gp, a knight's squire for 200 gp,
and a king's man for 500 gp. These are paid
for by the lord of the prisoner. A player
character (as a lord and master) is expected
‘- NI'Cs (Player Character Obligations)
to do the same. Of course, the player char-
acter can pass much of this cost on to his
own subiects and the relatives of the pris-
oner. Thus men might languish for long per-
iods in the hands of the enemy before their
ransom was raised. Furthermore, should a
player character ransom a hireling, fol-
lower. or henchman, he has every reason to
expect loyal service from that man in the
future. After all, he has demonstrated his
willingness to save that NPC from hardship
and death.
ln a fantasy world, a player character is
also expected to bear the cost of magical
spells cast to the benefit of his men. He may
arrange to have his men blessed before bat-
tle or healed after it. He shouldn't grumble
about the expense, because the spells also
make good tactical sense. The bless spell
increases the success of his army in the field.
Magical cures get his army back on its feet
quicker. All these things can make him very
successful while also making him popular
with his hired men.
Finally, the player character is expected to
make an effort to raise or restore slain
henchmen. This is not a normal expectation
of hirelings or followers (although it can
happen in extreme cases). The effort should
be honest and true. A player character
shouldn't fool himself into thinking no one
will notice if he doesn't do his utmost. The
player character who returns from an
adventure minus his henchman is automati-
cally under a cloud of suspicion, despite his
most vehement protests. A player character
must take great care to maintain his reputa-
tion as a good and upright employer.

Before a character can do anything in the
dungeon or the wilderness, he has to be able
to see what he is doing. lf a character can't
see a target, his chances of hitting it are very
small. If he can't see. he can't read a scroll or
a large “Keep Out" sip on the wall. In the
ADltD° game, characters can see set dis-
tances and often by fantastic means that
defy logic.
Limits of Vision
The ﬁrst limitation
on vision is how far away an object can be
before it cannot been seen clearly. Size and
weather have a great effect on this. Moun-
tains can be seen from great distances. 60 to
100 miles or more, yet virtually no detail
can be seen. On level ground. the horizon is
about ﬁve to 12 miles away, but a character
usually cannot see a speciﬁc object that far
away. The limit of vision for seeing and
identifying man-sized objects is much less
than this.
Under optimum conditions, the maxi-
mum range at which a man-sized object can
be seen is about 1,500 yards, if it is moving.
If the object doesn't move. it usually cannot

be seen at this distance. Even if it is moving,
all that can be seen is a moving object. The
character cannot tell what it is or what it is
doing.
At 1,000 yards, both moving and station-
ary man—sized objects can be spotted. Gen-
eral size and shape can be determined, but
exact identiﬁcations are impossible. lt is not
likely that creature type can be identiﬁed at
this range, unless the creature has a very
unique shape.
At 500 yards. general identifications can
be made. Size. shape, color. and creature
type are all distinguishable. Individuals still
cannot be identiﬁed, unless they are distinc-
tively dressed or separated from the rest of
II1
the group. Livery and heraldic symbols or
banners can seen if large and bold. Most
coats of arms cannot be distinguished at this
distance. Gmeral actions can be ascertained
with conﬁdence.
At 100 yards, individuals can be identi-
ﬁed (unless, of course, their features are
concealed). Coats of arms are clear. Most
actions are easily seen. although small
events are unclear.
At 10 yards, all details but the smallest
are clear. Emotions and actions are easily
seen, including such small actions as pick-
pocketing (if it is detectable).
Of course, conditions are seldom perfect.
There are a number of factors that can
reduce visibility and alter the ranges at
which things can be spotted and identified.
Table 62 lists the effects of different types of
conditions.
All ranges are given in yards.
"Movement" indicates the maximum dis-
tance at which a moving figure can be seen.
"Spotted" is the maximum distance a mov-
ing or a stationary figure can be seen.
"Type" gives the maximum distance at
which the general details of a ﬁgure can be
seen—species or race, weapons, etc. "ID"
range enables exact (or reasonably exact)
identification. "Detail" range means small
actions can be seen clearly.
There are many factors other than weath-
er that affect viewing. Size is an important
factor. When looking at a small creature
(size S). all categories are reduced to the
next lower category (except the “detail”
range, which remains unchanged). Thus,
under clear conditions, the ranges for seeing
a small creature are "movement" at 1,000
yards, "spotted" at 500 yards, "type" at 100
yards, and “ID” and "detail" at 10 yards.
When sighting large creatures, the “move-
ment,” "spotting," and “type” ranges are
doubled. Exceptionally large creatures can
be seen from even greater distances. Large
groups of moving creatures can be seen at
great distances. Thus it is easy to see a herd
of buffalo or an army on the march.
The ranges given in Table 62 do not take
terrain into account. All ranges are based on
flat. open ground. Hills, mountains, tall
grass. and dense woods all drastically
reduce the chances of seeing a creature. (The
terrain does not alter sighting ranges, only
the chanoes of seeing a creature.) Thus, even



though on a clear day woods may hide a
bear until he is 30 yards away, it is still a
clear day for visibility. The bear, once seen,
can be quickly and easily identified as a
bear. The DM has more information on spe-
cific terrain effects on sighting.
As a final caveat, the rangs in Table 62
assume Earth-like conditions. Sighting con-
ditions on one of the Lower Planes, or the
horizon distance on another world, could be
entirely different. lf your DM feels he must
take this into account, he will have to learn
more about the subject at his local library or
make it up.
light
Most characters can-
not see much without light. Some night con-
ditions (those for the outdoors) are given in
Table 62. But allot these assume some small
amount of light. ln totally lightless condi~
tions, normal vision is impossible, unless a
source of light is carried by the party.
Light sources vary in the area they affect.
Table 63 gives tl\e radius of light and burn-
ing time for the most common types of light
sources.

DM allows this optional rule.
Of course, while a lantern or fire enables
characters to see. it does have some disad-
vantages. The greatest of these is that it is
hard to sneak up on someone if he can see
you coming. lt is hard to remain inconspicu-
ous when you have the only campfire on the
plain, or you are carrying the only tordi in
the dungeon. Furthermore, not only do
creatures know you are coming, they can
generally see you before you see them (since
the light source illuminates the area around
you, those outside this area can see into the
area)- Characters should always bear these
risks in mind.
lnfravlslon
Some characters
and monsters have the power of infrnvision .
This can mean one ot two things, depending
on whether the standard or the optional nile
isusedhhisisdiscussedindetailinthe
Dungeon Master's Guide). The choice is left
to the DM and he must tell the players how
he wants inﬁ-avision to work. Regardless of
how the power functions, the range of intra-
vision is at most 60 feet unless otherwise
noted.
Light (light)
llslng Minors
At times it is useful
for characters to look at objects or creatures
via reﬂections in a mirror. This is particular-
ly true of thou creatures so hideous (such as
a medusa) that gazing directly upon them
might turn the viewer to stone. When using
a minor, a light source must be present. Sec-
ond, attempting to direct your actions by
looking in a mirror is very disorienting (try
it and see). Thus, all actions requiring an
ability or proﬁciency check or an attack roll
suffer a -2 penalty. The character also loses
all Dexterity bonuses to Armor Class if
fighting an opponent seen only in a mirror.

As in the real world, time passes in all
AD&D‘3’ game worlds. Weeks slip away as
wizards research spells. Days go by as char-
acters ride across country. Hours pass while
exploring ruins. Minutes flash by during
battles. All of these are passages of time.
There are two different types of time that
are talked about in these rules. Game time is
the imaginary time that passes for the char-
acters in the game. Real time is the time in
the real world, the time that passes for the
players and DM as they play the ADkD
game. The two times are very different:
players and DMs should be careful to distin-
guish game time from real time.
For example, when the character
Delsenora researches a spell for three weeks,
this is three weeks of game time. Delsenora
is out of action as three weeks passes in the
campaign world. Since nothing interesting
at all happens to Delsenora during this
research time, it should require only a min-
ute or two of real time to handle the situa-
tion. The exchange in real time is something
like this.-
Lourse (Delsenoras player): "Delsenoras
going to research her new spell."
DM: "Okay, it‘Il take three weeks. Nothing
happens to her. While shes doing that,
the rest of you get a chance to heal your
wounds and do some stuff that you've
been ignoring. Iohann /pointing at
anotherplayerl, you'd betterspendsome
time at the church. The patriarchs been a
little upset that you haven't been attend-
ing ceremonies."
Ion (Iohann's player): "Can't Igo out and
eam some more experience?"
DM (Not wanting to deal with a split-up
group): "The patriarch mumbles some-
thing about failing in your duties to your
deity, and he rubs his holy symbol a lot.
You know, it's not very often that low
le'ueLs like you have personal audiences
with the patriarch. What do you think?”
Ion: "Marvelous. Subtle hint. I'll stay and
be a good boy.”
DM: "Well, great! The three weeks pass.
Nothing happens. Del, make your roll
for the spell research."
And so three weeks of game time ﬂash by
in brief minutes of real time.
The importance of game time is that as a
campaign progresses, characters tend to
become involved in different time-
consuming projects. Three characters may
set off on a four-week overland journey,
while a mage researches for six weeks. At
the inn, a ﬁghter rests and heals his wounds
for two weeks. It is important to note how
much time passes on different tasks, so the
activities of different characters can be fol-
lowed.
Campaign time is measured just as it is in
Chapter I4: Time and Movement real life: years, months, weeks, days, hours,
minutes, and seconds. But. since this is a
fantasy game, the DM can create entirely
different calendars for his world. There may
be only ten months in the year or 63 days to
a month. When beginning play. these things
are not tremendously important, so players
need not worry about them right away.
With continued adventuring, players even-
tually become familiar with the calendar of
the campaign.
Rounds and turns are units of time that
are often used in the AD&D game, particu-
larly for spells and combat. A round is
approximately equal to a minute (it is not
exactly one minute, so as to grant the DM
some ﬂexibility during combat). A tum is
equal to ten minutes of game time. Turns are
normally used to measure specific tasks
(such as searching) and certain spells. Thus
a spell that lasts ten turns is equal to 100
minutes or 11/; hours.
Movement
Closely related to
time is movement. Clearly your character is
able to move, otherwise adventures would
be rather static and boring. But how fast can
he move? lf a large, green carrion crawler is
scuttling after Rath, is the redoubtable
dwarf fast enough to escape’! Could Rath
outmn an irritated but heavily loaded elf?
Sooner or later these considerations become
important to player characters.
All characters have movement rates that
are based on their race. Table 64 lists the
movement rates for unencumbered charac-
ters of different races.
Table 64: BASE MOVEMENT RATES
Race Rate
Human 12
Dwarf 6
Elf 12
Half-elf 12
Gnome 6
Halfling 6
A character can normally walk his move-
ment rate in tens of yards in a single round.
An unencumbered human can walk 120
yards (360 feet), slightly more than a toot-
ball field, in one minute. A dwarf, similarly
equipped, can walk 60 yards in the same
time. This walk is at a fairly brisk. though
not strenuous, pace that can be kept up for
long periods of time.
However, a character may have to move
slower than this pace. If the character is car-
rying equipment, he may move slower
because of the encumbrance (see page 76), if
this optional rule is used. As the character
carries more gear, he gradually slows dOWI\
until he reaches the point where he can bare-
ly move at all.
When a character is moving through a
dungeon or similar setting, his movement
rate corresponds to tens of feet per round
(rather than the tens of yards per round of
outside movement). It is assumed that the
character is moving more cautiously, pay-
ing attention to what he sees and hears while
avoiding traps and pitfalls. Again, this rate
can be lowered if the optional encumbrance
system is used.
II9



Time and Movement (logging and Running)
Characters can also move faster than the
normal walking pace. ln the dungeon (or
anytime the character is using his dungeon
movement rate) the character can automati-
cally increase his movement to that of his
normal walking pace. ln doing so, however,
he suffers a *1 penalty to his chance of
being surprised and gives a +1 bonus to
others on their chance of being surprised by
him (the rapidly moving character is not
taking care to conceal the noise of his pas-
sage in the echoing confines of the under-
ground). Furthermore the character does
not notice traps, secret doors, or other unu-
sual features.
lt is also certainly possible for a character
to jog or run—an especially useful thing
when being chased by creatures tougher
than he cares to meet. The simplest method
for handling these cases is to roll an initia-
tive die. if the ﬂeeing character wins, he
increases the distance between himself and
his pursuers by 10 times the difference in the
two dice (in feet or yards, whichever the
DM feels is most appropriate). This is
repeated each tum until the character
escapes or is captured. (if this seems unreal-
istic, remember that fear and adrenaline can
do amazing things!)
logging and Running
(Optional llle)
If your DM
wants greater precision in a chase, the
speeds of those involved in the chase an
be calculated exactly. (But this is time-
consmning and can slow down an excit-
ing chase.) Using this optional rule, a
character mn always double his normal
movement rate (in yards) to a jog. Thus a
character with a movement rate of 12
oaniogliﬂyardsina round. While)og-
ging, a dtaracter can automatically keep
going for the number of rounds equal to
his Constitution. After this limit has
been reached, the player must roll a suc-
oeaf\|.lConstitutioncheckattheendof
each additional round spent jogging.
There are no modifiers to this check.
Once a Constitution check is failed, the
character must atop and rest for as many
rounds as he spent jogging. After this. he

duration apply).

Strength check means only that the char-
actor annot increase his speed to the
level he was trying to reach, but he can
keep running at the pace he was at before
the failed Strength check. Once a chanc-
ter fails a Strength check to teach a level
of running, he cannot try to reach that
level again in the same rtm.
Continued running requirs a Consti-
tution check every round. with penalties
that depend on how long and how fast
the character has been running. There is
a -1 penalty foreach round of running
at triple speed, a -2 penalty for each
round of nrnning at quadruple speed.
and a -3 penalty for each round of run-
ning at quintuple speed (these penalties
are cumulative). lf the check is passed,
the character can continue at that speed
for the next round. If the check is failed.
the character has exhausted himself and
must stop nmning. The character must
rest for at least one tum.
For example, Ragnar the thief has n

a movement rate of 12. Being pursued by
the city guard. he stnrrs jogging at Z40

guardsmen drop our of the race. but n
few hold in there. Ragnar now hm a -1

rolled. so he inst barely passes.
Bu! one of the blasted guardsmen is
still on his tail! In desperation, Ragnar
tries to go /aster (trying for four times
walking weed). The Strength check is an

but he is still running three times faster

ple speed). The player rolls the die and
gets a 4—no problem! And just then the
last guardsmnn drops out of the race.
Ragnar takes no charms and keeps mn-
rring. Next round another Constitution
check B necessary. with a -3 penalty.
The player rolls an 18. Exhausted.
Ragnar collapses in a shadowy alley, tak-
ing care to get out of sight.
Cross-Country Movement
A normal day's
marching lasts for ten hours, including rea-
sonable stops for rest and meals. Under nor-
mal conditions, a character can walk twice
his movement rate in miles in those ten
hours. Thus an unencumbered man can
I10
walk 24 miles across clear terrain.
Characters can also force march, inten-
tionally hurrying along, at the risk of
exhaustion. Force marching enables a char-
acter to travel 2 1/z times his movement rate
in miles (thus a normal man could force
rnarch 30 miles in a day). At the end of each
day of the march, the character or creature
must roll a Constitution check. Large par-
ties (such as army units) make the check at
the average Constitution of the group
(weaker members are supported, encour-
aged, and goaded by their peers). Creatures
must roll a saving throw vs. death at the end
of each day's force marching (since they lack
Constitution scores). A -1 penalty is
applied to the check for each consecutive
day spent force marching. if the check is
passed, the force marching pace can be con-
tinued the next day. If the check fails, no
more force marching attempts can be made
until the characters have completely recov-
ered frorn the ordeal. Recovery requires ‘/1
day per day of force marching.
Even if the Constitution check fails, the
character can continue overland movement
at his normal rate.
One drawback of force marching is that
each day of force marching results in a -1
penalty to all attack rolls. This modifier is
cumulative. Half a day's rest is required to
remove one day's worth of force marching
penalty. Characters who have managed to
force march for eight straight dayssuffera -8
penalty to their attack rolls; it takes four days
of rat to retum to no attack roll penalty.
Overland movement rates can be
increased or decreased by many factors.
Terrain can speed or slow movement. Well-
tended roads allow faster marching, while
trackless mountains slow marches to a
snail's pace. Lack of food, water, and sleep
weaken characters. Poor weather slows
their pace. All these factors are detailed in
the DMG.
Swimming
All characters are
either untrained swimmers or proficient
swimmers.
When the DM determines the swimming
ability of characters, the decision should be
based on his campaign. If the campaign is
centered around a large body of water, or if
a character grew up near the sea, chances
are good that the character knows how to
swim. However, being a sailor does not
guarantee that a character can swim. Many
a medieval mariner or black-hearted pirate
never leamed how to swim and so devel-
oped a morbid fear of the waterl This is one
of the things that made "walking the plank”
such a fearful punishment. Furthennore,
some character races are normally suspi-
cious of water and swimming. While these
may vary from campaign to campaign,

dwarves and halflings often don't know
how to swim.
Untrained swimmers are a fairly hapless
lot. When they are unencumbered, they can
manage a rough dog-paddle in relatively
calm waters. If the waters are rough, the
current strong, or the depth excessive (at sea
or far out on a lake), untrained swimmers
may panic and sink. If weighed down with
enough gear to reduce their movement rate.
they sink like stones, unable to keep their
heads above water. in no way do they make
any noticeable progress (unless, of course.
the object is to sink beneath the surface).
Proﬁcient swimmers are able to swim,
dive, and surface with varying degrees oi
success. All proficient characters are able to
swim 1/z their current land movement rate
times 10 in yards, provided they are not
wearing metal armor. A character with a
movement rate of 12 could swim 60 yards
(180 feet) in a round. Characters whose
movement rates have been reduced to 1/; or
less of normal (due to gear) or who are
wearing metal armor cannot swim—the
weight of the gear pulls the character under.
They can still walk on the bottom, however,
at ‘la their Current movement rate.
Proficient swimmers can double their
swimming speed, if a successful Strength
check is rolled (vs. V: the character's normal
Strength score). For a character with a
movement rate of 12, a successful check
means he can swim 120 yards in one round,
an Olympic-class performance.
Like running, swimming is not something
that a character can do indeﬁnitely. There
are several different speeds a character can
choose to swim at, thus moving in either
short sprints or a slower, but longer-lasting.
pace.
" If swimming at 1/2 normal speed or
treading water. the character can maintain
this for a number of hours equal to his Con-
stitution score (although he will have to
abandon most of his gear). After a character
/
94
swims for a number of hours equal to his
Constitution, a Constitution check must be
made for each additional hour. For each
extra hour of swimming, 1 Constitution
point is temporarily lost (regaining lost abil-
ity points is explained in the next column).
Each hour spent swimming causes a
cumulative penalty of - 1 to all attack rolls.
All this assumes calm water. If the seas
are choppy, a Constitution check should be
made every hour spent  regard-
less of the character's Constitution. Rough
seas can require more frequent checks;
heavy seas or storms may require a check
every round. The DM may decide that
adverse conditions cause a character's Con-
stitution score to drop more rapidly than 1
point per hour.
If a swimming character fails a Constitu-
tion check, he must tread water for ‘/2 hour
before he can continue swimming (this
counts as time spent swimming, for pur-
poses of Constitution point loss).
A character drowns if his Constitution
score drops to O.
As an example, a freak wave sweeps Fiera
(an elf) overboard during the night. Fortu-
nately she can swim and knows that land is
nearby. Bravely, she sets out through calm
water. Her Constitution score is 16. After 14
hours of steady swimming, she makes out
an island on the horizon. Two hours later
she is closer, but still has some way to go.
During the next hour (her 17th in the water),
her Constitution drops to 15 (her attack
penalty is -17.‘) and she must make a Con-
stitution check. A 12 is rolled-she passes.
In the last hour, the 18th, the seas become
rough. Her Constitution is now 13 (the DM
ruled that the heavy seas made her lose 2
points of Corlstitution this hour). and the
DM decides she must pass an extra Consti-
tution checlr to reach shore. She rolLs a 5 and
flops onto shore, exhausted.
Ill
Q.
‘ Characters can also swim long distances
at a faster pace, although at increasing risk.
Swimming at the character's normal move-
ment rate (instead of the usual swimming
speed of ‘/2 the normal movement rate)
requires a Constitution check every hour,
reduces Strength and Constitution by 1
point every hour, and results in a -Z cumu-
lative attack penalty for each hour of swim-
ming. Charactcrs can swim at twice this
speed (quadruple normal swimming speed),
but they must roll a check every turn and
suffer the above penalties for every tum
spent swimming. Again, when an ability
score readies 0, the character sinks and
drowns.
' Upon reaching shore, characters can
recover lost ability score points and negate
attack penalties by resting. Each day of rest
recovers 1d6 ability points (if both Strength
and Constitution points were lost, roll 1d3
for each ability to determine points recov-
ered) and removes 2d6 points of attads pen-
alties. Rest assumes adequate food and
water. Characters need not be fully rested
before undertaking any activity, although
the adjusted ability scores are treated as the
character's current scores until the character
has rested enough to fully recover from the
swim.
To continue the earlier example with Fiem,
afterabadlasthourinthewater, she reachs
shore. Her Constitution is 13 and she hm a
— 18 penalty to herattack roll. Erhausted, she
finds some ripefruitand collapss in the shade
ofa palm tree. All the next dayshe rests. At
thezndofthedayshe rolLsa4on ldomld
regains 4 points of Constitution, rstor-Eng it to
normal. An 8 is rolled to reduce her attack
penalty, so the nextdnyshesuffers only a -10
penalty to herattack roll. Thenextdayofrest
lowers thisbyﬁto -4andthetht'rddayerases
it completely. So in three days she has fully
recovered from her 18-hour ordeal in the
water.



ll
Holding Your Breath
Under normal cir-
cumstances (with a good gulp of air and not
performing strenuous feats), a character can
hold his breath up to ‘/1 his Constitution
score in rounds (rounded up). If the charac-
ter is exerting himself, this time is halved
(again rounded up). Characters reduced to
‘ls or less of their normal movement be-
cause of encumbrance are always consid-
ered to be exerting themselvesr lf unable to
get a good gulp of air, these times are re-
duced by ‘/1. All characters are able to hold
their breath for one round, regardless of cir-
cumstances.
While attempting to hold his breath be-
yond this time, the character must roll a
Constitution check each round. The first
check has no modifiers, but each subsequent
check suffers a -2 cumulative penalty.
Once a check is failed, the character must
breathe (if he cannot reach the surface, he
drowns).
Diving: All characters can dive to a depth
of 20 feet in a single round. For each encum-
brance category above unencumbered (or
for each point of movement below the char-
acter's normal rate, if this optional system is
used—see page 76), two feet is added to this
depth (the additional weight helps pull the
character down). A short run or a few feet
of height adds 10 feet of depth to the first
round of a dive. For every 10 feet of height
above the water, an additional five feet of
depth is added, up to a maximum addition
of 20 feet. Thus, with a run and from a
height of 40 feet or more, an unencumbered
man can dive 50 feet in a single round.
Surfacing: A character can nonnally rise
at the rate of 20 feet per round. This rate is
reduced by two feet for every encumbrance
category above unencumbered or for every
point of current movement below the char-
acter's normal rate (if this optional system is
used). Note that, under the optional encum-
brance system, heavily loaded characters
(those who have lost 10 or more points off
their normal movement rate because of their
current encumbrance) cannot even swim to
the surface. Those simply floating to the
surface (unconscious characters, for exam-
ple) rise at a rate that is five feet per round
slower than someone similarly encumbered
who is actively swimming up to the surface.
Time and Movement (Climbing)
lt is quite possible for a moderately
weighed-down character to sink if he makes
no effort to stay on the surface.
Climbing
Although thieves
have specialized climbing abilities, all char-
acters are able to climb to some degree or
another. Climbing ability is divided into
three categories: thief, mountaineer, and
unskilled.
Thieves are the most skilled at climbing.
They are the only characters who can climb
very smooth, smooth, and rough surfaces
without the use of ropes or other equip-
ment. They are the fastest of all climbers
and have the least chance of falling.
Mountaineers are characters with moun-
taineering proficiency or those the DM
deems to possess this skill. They have a bet-
ter climbing percentage than unskilled char-
acters. Mountaineers with proper equip-
ment can climb very smooth, smooth, and
rough surfaces. They can assist unskilled
characters in all types of climbs.
Unskiiled climbers are the vast majority
of characters. While they are able to scram-
ble over rocks, they cannot use climbing
equipment or negotiate very smooth,
smooth, and rough surfaces. They have the
lowest climbing success rate of all charac-
ters,
Calculating Success
The chance of suc-
cess of a climb is calculated by taking the
character's skill level (given as a percentage)
and modifying it for his race, the condition
of the surface, and situational modifiers. Ta-
ble 65 lists the percentages for the different
categories of climbers.
The chance of success given in Table 65 is
modified by many factors. Some of these re-
main the same from climb to climb (such as
a character's race) and can be figured into
the character's base score. Others depend on
the conditions of a given climb. All of these
are listed on Table 66.

The final result of Tables 65 and 66 is the
number the character uses for Climbing
checks. A Climbing check is made by rolling
percentile dice. lf the number rolled is equal
to or less than the number found from Ta-
bles 6S and 66, the character succeeds with
the Climbing check. Rolls above this num-
ber indicate failure.
A Climbing check must be made any time
a character tries to climb a height of 10 feet
or more. This check is made before the char-
acter ascends the first 10 feet of the climb. If
the check is passed, the character can con-
tinue climbing. lf the check is failed, the
character is unable to find a route and can-
not even attempt the climb. No further at-
tempts can be made by that character until a
change occurs. This is either a signiﬁcant
change in location (a half mile or more
along the face of a cliff) or an improvement
in the character's chance of success.
For example. Brondvrouw the gnome is
an unskilled climber. Her normal chnnce of
success is 25% (40% — 15% for being a
gnome). She has been cut offfmm the rest of
the party by a rugged cliff. 50 feet high. For-
tunately, the cliff B dry and the rock seems
solid. She makes an attempt, but u 49 is
rolled on the percentile dice. She cannot
climb the cliff. Then one of her friends up
above remembers to lowera rope. With the
rope, Brondvrouw can again try the climb,
since her percentage chance is now 80%. A
27 is rolled and she makes the ascent.



On particularly long climbs—those
geater than 100 feet or requiring more than
one turn (10 minutes) of climbing time—the
DM may require additional checks. The fre-
quency of these checks is for the DM to
decide. Characters who fail a check could
fallaverylorigwaysoitiswisetocarry
ropes and tools.
Clllnblng Rates
Climbing is differ-
ent from walking or any other type of
movement a character can do. The rate at
which a character moves varies greatly with
the different types of walls and surfaces that
must be climbed. Refer to Table 67. Crossro-
ference the type of surface to be climbed
with the surface condition. Multiply the
appropriate number from the table by the
character's current movement rate. The
result is the rate of climb for the character,
in feet per round, in any direction (up,
dovm, or sideways).
All the movement rates given on Table 67
are for non-thief characters. Thief charac-
ters are able to climb at double the move-
ment rate for non-nal characters.
Ragnar the thief and his companion
Rupert (a half-cl/) are climbing a cliff with
rough ledges. A recent rain has left the sur-
face slightly slippery. Ragnar has a move-
ment rate of Z2 and Rupert's is 8. Ragnar can
cover 12 feet per round (12 X 1 since he is a
thief), but Rupert struggles along at the pace
of4 feet per round (8 X 1/2). If Ragnar had
gone up first and lowered a rope to Rupert,
the half-elf could have climbed at the rate of
8 feet per round using rope and wall (8 X 1).

' Non-thief characters must be mountaineers and have appropriate tools (pitons, rope,
etc.) to climb these surfaces.
" Thief characters can climb very smooth, slightly slippery surfaces at 1/4.
Even thieves cannot climb very smooth, slippery surfaces.
Types of Surfaces
Very smooth sur-
faces include expanses of smooth, ur\crack-
ed rock, flush-fitted wooden walls, and
welded or bolted metal walls. Completely
smooth walls, unbroken by any feature,
cannot be climbed by anyone without tools.
Smooth and cracked Walls indude most
types of well-built masonry, cavern walls,
maintained castle walls, and slightly eroded
cliff faces.
Rough faces are most natural cliffs, poor-
ly maintained or badly built masonry, and
typical wooden walls or stockades. Any
natural stone surface is a rough face.
Rough with ledges is similar to rough
faces but is dotted with grips three inches or
more wide. Frost-eroded cliffs and natural
chimneys are in this category, as are mason-
ry buildings falling into ruin.
Ice walls are cliffs or faces made entirely
of frozen ice. These are different from very
smooth and smooth surfaces in that there
are still many natural cracks and protru-
sions. They are extremely dangerous to
climb, so a Climbing check should be made
every round for any character attempting it
without tools.
Trees includes climbs with an open frame-
work, such as a scaffold, as well as trees.
Sloping walls means not quite cliff-like
but too steep to walk up. If a character falls
while climbing a sloping wall, he suffers
damage only if he fails a saving throw vs.
petrification. If the save is made. the charac-
ter slides a short distance but is not harmed.
Rope and wall requ.ire that the character
uses a rope and is able to brace himself
against a solid surface.
Actions While Cllmblng
Although it is pos-
sible to perform other actions while climb-
ing, such as spellcasting or fighting, it is not
easy. Spellcasters can use spells only if they
are in a steady, braced position, perhaps
with the aid of other characters.
Climbing characters lose all Armor Class
bonuses for Dexterity and shield and most
often have rear attack modiﬁers applied
against them also. Their own attack, dam-
age, and saving throw rolls suffer -2 penal-
ties. Those attaddng from above gain a +2
bonus to their attack rolls, while those
attacking from below suffer an additional
-2 penalty to their attack rolls. A climbing
I23



Time and Movement (Climbing)
character cannot use a two—handed weapon
while climbing. The DM can overrule these
penalties if he feels the player character has
reached a place of secure footing. If struck
while climbing (for any amount of damage),
the character must make an immediate
Climbing check. Failure for a roped charac-
ter means he spends a round regaining his
balance; an unroped character falls if he
fails this check.
Cllmblng Tools
Tools are an inte—
gral part of any mountaineer's equipment
and all climbs can profit from the use of
tools. Mountaineering tools include rope.
pitons (spikes), and ice axes. However, it is
a mistaken belief that the main function of
tools is to aid in a climb. The main purpose
of pitons, rope, and the like is to prevent a
disastrous fall. Climbers must rely on their
own skills and abilities. not ropes and
spikes, when making a climb. Accidents
happen when people forget this basic rule
and trust their weight to their ropes and
pitons.
Therefore, aside from ropes, other tools
do not increase the chance of climbing suc-
cess. However, in the case of a fall, climbing
tools can reduce the distance fallen. When a
character falls, he can fall only as far as the
rope allows, if being belayed, or as far as
twice the distance to the last piton set (if the
piton holds—a piton pulls free 15% of the
time when a sudden stress occurs). The dis-
tance fallen depends on how far apart the
pitons have been set. Falling characters fall
twice the distance to the last spike that
holds.
For example, Ruth is 15 feet above his last
piton. Suddenly he slips. He falls the 15 feet
to his piton, plus another 15 [set past his
piton since there's 15 feet of rope between
him and the piton, for a total of 30 feet
fallen and 3d6 points of falling damage.
Roping characters together increases indi-
vidual safety, but it also inaeases the chance
that more than one person falls. When a
character falls, the character(s) on either
side of the falling climber must roll Climb—
ing checks (a penalty of -'10 is applied for
each falling character after the first one to
fall). lf all checls are successful, the fall is
stopped and no one suffers any damage. If a
check is failed, that character also falls and
Climbing checks must be repeated as before.
Climbing checks are made until either the
fall is stopped (the climbers on either side of
the falling characterlsl successfully roll
Climbing checks or the last nonfalling
climber succeeds with his check), or all the
roped-together characters fall.
For example, a party of ﬁve is roped
together as they go up the cliff. Suddenly
Iohann falls. Megarran, immediately above
him, and Drelb, following him. must roll
Climbing checks. Megnr-ran passes her
check. But Drelb fails and is snapped off the
wall. Now Megar-ran must make another
check with a -10 penalty (for two falling
characters), and Targash, who‘: bringing up
the rear, must also roll a check with a -10
penalty. Both succeed on their rolls and the
fall is stopped.
Getting Down
Aside from jump»
ing or flying, the quickest way to get down
from a height is to rappel. This requires a
rope attached at the top of the climb and a
skilled mountaineer to set up the rappel and
to hold the rope at the bottom. When rap-
peling down a surface, a Climbing check
with a +50 bonus must be rolled. Free rap-
pels (the end of the rope unsupported at the
bottom) can also be done, but the modifier
is only +30. Of course, a failed check
results in a slip sometime during the rappel
(the DM decides on the damage suffered). A
character can rappel at a speed equal to his
normal dungeon movement (120 feetl round
for an unencumbered human). One other
thing to bear in mind is that there must be a
landing point at the end of the rope. Rap-
pelling 60 feet down a 100-foot cliff means
the character is either stranded at the end of
the rope or, worse still, rappels right off the
end and covers the last 40 feet much faster
than he did the ﬁrst 60!

Spell Descriptions
The spells are orga-
nized according to their group (Priest or
Wizard) and level, starting on page 131.
Within each level, the spells are arranged al-
phabetically. At the start of each spell de-
scription are the following important game
statistics:
Name: Each spell is identiﬁed by name. In
parentheses after the name is the school (for
wizard spells) to which that spell belongs.
When more than one is listed, that spell is
common to all schools given.
Some spells are reversible (they can be
cast for an effect opposite to that of the
standard spell). This is noted after the spell
name. Priests with reversible spells must
memorize the desired version. For example,
a priest who desires a cause light wounds
spell must petition for this form of the spell
when meditating and praying. Note that se-
vere penalties can result if the spell choice is
at variance with the priest's alignment (pos-
sible penalties include denial of specific
spells, entire spell levels, or even all spells
for a certain period. The exact result (if any)
depends on the reaction of the priest's pa-
tron deity, as determined by the DM.
Reversible wizard spells operate similarly.
When the spell is leamed, both forms are re-
corded in the wizard's spell books. How-
ever, the wizard must decide which version
of the spell he desires to cast when memoriz-
ing the spell, unless the spell description spe-
cifically states otherwise. For example, a
wizard who has memorized stone to flesh
and desires to cast flesh to stone must wait
until the latter form of the spell can be mem-
orized (i.e., rest eight hours and study). if he
can memorize two 6th-level spells, he could
memorize each version once or one version
twice.
School: In parentheses after the spell
name is the name of the school of magic to
which the spell belongs. For wizard spells,
this defines which spells a wizard specialist
can learn, depending on the Wizard's school
of specialization. For priest spells, the
school notation is used only for reference
purposes, to indicate which school the spell
is considered to belong to, in case the DM
needs to know for spell resistance (e.g.,
elves’ resistance to charm spells).
Sphere: This entry appears only for priest
spells and identifies the sphere or spheres
into which each spell falls.
Range: This lists the distance from the
caster at which the spell effect occurs or be-
gins. A "O" indicates the spell can be used on
the caster only, with the effect embodied
within or emanating from him. "Touch"
means the caster can use the spell on others
if he can physically touch them. Unless oth-
erwise specified, all other spells are centered
on a point visible to the caster and within
the range of the spell. The point can be a
ll
Appendix z= Notes on Spells "
creature or object if desired. ln general, a
spell that affects a limited number of crea-
tures within an area affects those closest to
the center first, unless there are other pa-
rameters operating (such as level or Hit
Dice). Spells can be cast through narrow
openings only if both the caster‘s vision and
the spell energy can be directed simultane-
ously through the opening. A wizard stand-
ing behind an arrow slit can cast through it;
sending a fireball through a small peephole
he is peering through is another matter.
Components: This lists the category of
components needed, V for verbal, S for so-
matic, and M for material. When material
components are required, these are listed in
the spell description. Spell components are
expended as the spell is cast, unless other-
wise noted. Clerical holy symbols are not
lost when a spell is cast. For cases in which
material components are expended at the
end of the spell (free action, shnpechange.
etc.), premature destruction of the compo-
nents ends the spell.
Duration: This lists how long the magical
energy of the spell lasts. Spells of instanta-
neous duration come and go the moment
they are cast, although the results of these
spells may be permanent and unchangeable
by normal means. Spells of permanent du-
ration last until the effects are negated by
some means, usually by a dispel magic.
Some spells have a variable duration. The
caster cannot choose the duration of spells,
in most cases. Spells with set durations
(e.g., 3 rounds/level of the wizard) must be
kept track of by the player. Spells of varia-
ble duration (e.g., 3 + 1d4 rounds) are st»
cretly recorded by the DM. Your DM may
warn you when spell du.rations are ap-
proaching expiration, but there is usually no
sign that a spell is going to expire; check
with your DM to determine exactly how he
handles this issue.
Certain spells can be ended at will by the
caster. ln order to dismiss these spells, the
original caster must be within range of the
spell's center of effect—within the same
range at which the spell can be cast. The
caster also must be able to speak words of
dismissal. Note that only the original caster
can dismiss his spells in this way.
Casting Time: This entry is important, if
the optional casting time modifier to initia-
tive is used. lf only a number is given, the
casting time is added to the caster’: initiative
die rolls. lf the spell requires a round or
number of rounds to cast, it goes into effect
at the end of the last round of casting time.
if Delsenora casts a spell that takes one
round, it goes into effect at the end of the
round in which she begins casting. lf the
spell requires three rounds to cast, it goes
into effect at the end of the third round.
Spells requiring a turn or more go into effect
at the end of the slated turn.
Area of Effect: This lists the creatures,
I29
volume, dimensions, weight, etc., that can
be affected by the spell. Spells with an area
or volume that can be shaped by the caster
will, unless the spell description specifically
states otherwise, have a minimum dimen-
sion of 10 feet in any direction. Thus a cloud
that has a 10-foot cube per caster level
might, when cast by a 12th-level caster,
have dimensions 10' X 10’ X 120', 20’ X
20' X 30', or any similar combination that
totals 12 10-foot cubes. Combinations such
as 5' X 10' X 240' are not possible unless
specifically stated.
Some spells (such as bless) affect the
friends or enemies of the caster. In all cases,
this refers to the perception of the caster at
the time the spell is cast. For example, a cha-
otic good character allied with a lawful neu-
tral cleric would receive the benefits of the
latter's blss spell.
Saving Throw: This lists whether the spell
allows the target a saving throw and ex-
plains the effect of a successful save: "Neg."
results in the spell having no effect; "1/2"
means the character suffers half the normal
amount of damage; "none" means no saving
throw is allowed. Wisdom adjustments to
saving throws apply only to enchantment/
charm spells.
Solid physical barriers provide saving
throw bonuses and damage reduction.
Cover and concealment may affect saving
throws and damage (the DM has additional
information about this).
A creature that successfully saves against
a spell with no apparent physical effect
(such as a chnmi, hold, or magic fur) may
feel a deﬁnite force or tingle that is charac-
teristic of a magical attack, if the DM de-
sires. But the exact hostile spell effect or
creature ability used cannot be deduced
from this tingle.
A being's carried equipment and posses-
sions are assumed to make their saving
throws against special attacks if the creature
makes its saving throw, unless the spell spe-
cifically states otherwise. if the creature fails
its saving throw, or if the attack form is par-
ticularly potent, saving throws may have to
be rolled to see if any possessions survive,
using either item saving throws (see the
DMG) or the beings saving throw. The DM
will inform you when this happens.
Any character can voluntarily forgo a
saving throw. This allows a spell or similar
attack that normally grants a saving throw
to have full effect on the character. Like-
wise, any creature can voluntarily lower its
magic resistance allowing a spell to auto-
matically function when cast on it. Foreg0-
ing a saving throw or magic resistance roll
need not always be voluntary. If a creature
or character can be tricked into lowering its
resistance, the spell will have full effect,
even if it is not the spell the victim believed
he was going to receive. The victim must
consciously choose to lower his resistance;



Notes on Spells
it is not sufficient that he is caught off guard.
For example, a character would receive a
saving throw if a mage in the party suddenly
attacked him with a fireball. even if the
mage had been friendly to that point. How-
ever, the same character would not receive a
saving throw if the mage convinced him
that he was about to receive a levitation
spell but cast a fireball instead. Your DM
will decide when NPCs have lowered their
resistances. You must tell your DM when
your character is lowering his resistance.
Spell Description: The text provides a
complete description of how the spell func-
tions and its game effects. It covers most
typical uses of the spell, if there are more
than one, but cannot deal with every possi-
ble application players might find. ln these
cases, the spell information in the text
should provide guidance on how to adjudi-
cate the situation.
Spells with multiple functions enable the
caster to select which function he wants to
use at the time of casting. Usually a single
function of a multiple-function spell is
weaker than a single-function spell of the
same level.
Spell effects that give bonuses or penalties
to abilities, attack rolls, damage rolls, sav-
ing throws. etc., are not usually cumulative
with each other or with other magic: the
strongest single effect applies. For example,
a fighter drinks a potion of giant strength
and then receives the Znd-level wizard spell
strength. Only the strongest magic (the po-
tion) is effective. When the potion's dura-
tion ends, however, the strength spell is still
in effect, until its duration also expires.
Adludlcattng Illusions
All illusions are
cases of DM adjudication: each depends
upon the exact situational factors deemed
significant by the DM. All of the following
points are only subsidiary guidelines to help
the DM maintain consistency.
Intrlnsically Deadly Illusions: “lnstant
kill" illusions that are automatically fatal re-
gardless of level, Hit Dice, or saving
throws: collapsing ceilings, inescapable
lava pits, etc. The absolute maximum effect
of these is to force a system shock check.
Surviving characters are not further af-
fected by that illusion.
Spell Effects: Illusions that duplicate spell
effects are keyed to the caster’s level (e.g., 8
10th-level illusionist casting a fireball can
create a convincing 10-die fireball). Exceed-
ing this limit creates a fatal flaw in the illu-
sion that negates its effect.
Monster Special Attacks: Before the
caster can effectively duplicate a monster's
special attack, the wizard must have under-
gone it (a wizard cannot conjure up the
twinkle in a medusa’s eye correctly without
actually experiencing it—i.e., having been
turned to stone by one).
Option; lllusionary monsters attack us-
ing the wizard's attack values. This would
be a subtle clue that the monsters are fake.
Option; Extend the spell level control to
m0nsters—the caster can create monsters
only if the total monster Hit Dice are equal
to or less than the casters level (an 8th-level
caster could convincingly do one hill giant,
two ogres, or four 2nd-level fighters).
lllusion spells require a higher degree of
DM-player interaction than other wizard
spells. The timing and staging of such spells
by the caster are extremely important. Ef-
fects that appear out of nowhere are not be-
lieved unless the caster takes this into
account. On the other hand, an illusionary
ﬁreball cast after a wizard has cast a real one
could have devastating effects.
The caster must maintain a show of real-
ism at all times when conducting an illusion
(if a squad of low-level fighters is created,
the caster dictates their hits, misses, damage
inflicted, apparent wounds, and so forth:
the DM decides whether the bounds of be-
lievability have been exceeded),
NFC illusions require careful preparation
by the DM, including clues to their nature.
I30
lntelligence is the best defense against illu-
sions. Low and non-intelligent creatures are
more vulnerable to illusions, unless the illu-
sion is completely outside their experience
or the illusion touches on an area of the
creatures’ particular competence. Undead
are generally immune to illusions, but they
are vulnerable to quasi-real effects, most of
which start to appear in the 4th-level spell
list.
Illusions usually cease to affect a charac-
ter if they are actively disbelieved. Disbelief
must be stated by the player, based on clues
provided by the DM. Players stating disbe-
lief must give a reason for disbelief based on
sensory information available to the charac-
ter. Failure to give such a reason results in
failure to disbelieve. The DM can impose
additional requirements or delays in recog-
nizing illusions (such as intelligence checks)
as needed, such as when one player is obvi-
ously parroting a discovery made by an-
other. Disbelief automatically forfeits a
saving throw if the effect is real.
For NPCS, a saving throw, Intelligence
check, or DM adjudication can be used to
determine disbelief, whichever the DM
deems appropriate.



first-Level Spells
Affect Normal Flres (Alteration)
Range: 5 yards/level
Components: V. S
Duration: 2 roundsl level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 10-foot radius
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the wizard to cause
nonmagical fires—from as small as a torch
or lantern to as large as the area of effect-—
to reduce in size and brightness to become
mere coals or increase in light to become as
bright as full daylight and increase the illu-
mination to double the normal radius. Note
that this does not affect either fuel consump-
tion or damage caused by the fire. The
caster can affect any or all fires in the spell's
area. He can alter their intensities with a sin-
gle gesture as long as the spell is in effect.
The spell lasts until the caster cancels it, all
fuel is burned, or the duration expires. The
caster can also extinguish all flames in the
area, which expends the spell immediately.
The spell does not affect fire elementals or
similar creatures.
Alarm (Abiuration, Evocation)
Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 4 hours + ‘/2 hour/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Up to a 20-foot cube
Saving Throw: None
When an alarm spell is cast, the wizard
causes a selected area to react to the pres-
ence of any creature larger than a normal
rat—anything larger than about one-half
cubic foot in volume or more than about
three pounds in weight. The area of effect
can be a portal, a section of floor, stairs, etc.
As soon as any creature enters the warded
area, touches it, or otherwise contacts it
without speaking a password established by
the caster, the alarm spell lets out a loud
ringing that can be heard clearly within a
60-foot radius. (Reduce the radius by 10 feet
for each interposing door and by 20 feet for
each substantial interposing wall.) The
sound lasts for one round and then ceases.
Ethereal or astrally projected creatures do
not trigger an alarm, but ﬂying or levitating
creatures, invisible creatures, or incorpor-
eal or gaseous creatures do. The caster can
dismiss the alarm with a single word.
The material components of this spell are
a tiny bell and a piece of very fine silver
wire.
Appendix 3 Wll
Armor (Conluratlon)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S. M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the wizard creates
a magical field of force that serves as if it
were scale mail armor (AC 6). The spell has
no effect on a person already armored or a
creature with Armor Class 6 or better. lt is
not cumulative with the shield spell, but it is
cumulative with Dexterity and, in the case
of fighter/mages, with the shield bonus.
The armor spell does not hinder movement,
adds no weight or encumbrance, nor does it
prevent spellcasting. lt lasts until success-
fully dispelled or until the wearer sustains
cumulative damage tOt3ling greater than 8
points +1 per level of the caster. (lt is im-
portant to note that the armor does not ab-
sorb this damage. The armor merely grants
an AC of 6; the wearer still suffers full dam-
age from any successful attacks.) Thus, the
wearer might suffer 8 points from an attack.
then several minutes later sustain an addi-
tional 1 point of damage. Unless the spell
were cast by a wizard of 2nd level or higher,
it would be dispelled at this time. Until it is
dispelled, the armor spell grants the wearer
full benefits of the Armor Class gained.
The material component is a piece of
finely cured leather that has been blessed by
a priest.
Audible Glamor (Illusion/Phantasm)
Range: 60 yards + 10 yards/level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 3 rounds/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Hearing range
Saving Throw: Special
When the audible glamer spell is cast, the
wizard causes a Volume of sound to arise,
at whatever distance he desires (within
range), and seem to recede, approach, or
remain at a fixed place as desired. The vol-
ume of sound created, however, is directly
related to the level of the spellcaster. The
volume is based upon the lowest level at
which the spell can be cast, 1st level. The
noise of the audible glamer at this level is
that of four men, maximum. Fach addi-
tional experience level of the wizard adds a
like volume, so that at 2nd level the wizard
can have the spell cause sound equal to that
of eight men. Thus, talking, singing,
shouting, walking, marching, or running
sounds can be created. The auditory illu-
sion created by an audible glamer spell can
be virtually any type of sound, but the rel-
ative volume must be commensurate with
the level of the wizard casting the spell. A
l3l
horde of rats running and squeal-ting is
about the same volume as eight men run-
ning and shouting. A roaring lion is equal
to the noise volume of 16 men, while a
roaring dragon is equal to the noise volume
of no fewer than 24 men.
A character stating that he does not be-
lieve the sound receives a saving throw, and
if it succeeds, the character then hears a
faint and obviously false sound, emanating
from the caster’s direction. Note that this
spell can enhance the effectiveness of the
phantasmal force spell.
The material component of the spell is a
bit of wool or a small lump of wax.
Iumlng Hands (Alteration)
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: 1/:
When the wizard casts this spell, a jet of
searing flame shoots from his fingertips. His
hands must be held so as to send forth a fan-
like sheet of ﬂames: the wiz.ard’s thumbs
must touch each other and ﬁngers must be
spread. The buming hands send out ﬂame
jets of five-foot length in a horizontal arc of
about 120 degrees in front of the wizard.
Any creature in the area of the flames suf-
fers 1d3 hit points of damage, plus 2 points
for each level of experience of the spell-
caster, to a maximum of 1d3 + 20 points of
fire damage. Those successfully saving vs.
spell receive half damage. Flammable mate-
rials touched by the fire burn (e.g., cloth,
paper, parchment, thin wood, etc.). Such
materials can be extinguished in the next
round if no other action is taken.
Cantrlp (All Schools)
Range: 10 feet
Components: V, S
Duration; 1 hour/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
Cantrips are minor spells studied by wiz-
ards during their apprenticeship, regardless
of school. The cantrip spell is a practice
method for the apprentice, teaching him
how to tap minute amounts of magical
energy. Once cast, the cantrip spell enables
the caster to create minor magical effects for
the duration of the spell. So minor are these
effects that they have severe limitations.
They are completely unable to cause a loss
of hit points, cannot affect the concentra-
tion of spellcasters, and can only create
small, obviously magical materials. Fur-
thermore, materials created by a cantrip are
extremely fragile and cannot be used as



tools of any sort. Lastly, a cantrip lad<s the
power to duplicate any other spell effects.
Whatever manifestation the cantrip
takes, it remains in effect only as long as the
wizard concentrates. Wizards typically use
cantrips to impress common folk, amuse
children, and brighten dreary lives. Com-
mon tricks with cantrips include tinklings of
ethereal music, brightening faded ﬂowers.
glowing balls that ﬂoat over the caster's
hand, puffs of wind to ﬂicker candles, spic-
ing up aromas and ﬂavors of bland food.
and little whirlwinds to sweep dust under
nigs. Combined with the unseen servant
spell, these are the tools to make housekeep-
ing and entertaining simpler for the wizard.
Change Sell (Illusion/Phantasml
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 2d6 rounds + Z roundsl level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the wizard to alter the
appearance of his for-m—including clothing
and equipment—to appear one foot shorter
or taller: thin. fat, or in between; human.
humanoid, or any other generally man-
shaped bipedal creature. The caster cannot
duplicate a specific individual. The spell
does not provide the abilities or mannerisms
of the chosen form. The duration of the spell
is Zdé rounds plus two additional rounds
per level of experience of the spellcaster. The
DM may allow a saving throw for disbelief
under certain circumstances: for example.
if the caster acts in a manner obviously
inconsistent with his chosen role. The spell
does not alter the perceived tactile (i.e..
touch) properties of the caster or his equip-
ment, and the ruse can be discovered in this
way.
Charm Person (Enchantment/Charm)
Range: 120 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time; 1
Area of Effect: 1 person
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell affects any single person it is
cast upon. The term person includes any
bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid
of man-size or smaller, such as brownies,
dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes.
goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs,
hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men,
nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and
others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be
charmed, but an ogre could not.
The person receives a saving throw vs.
spell to avoid the effect, with any adjust-
ment due to Wisdom (see Table 5). lf the
person receives damage from the casters
group in the same round the charm is cast.
an additional bonus of +1 per hit point of
damage received is added to the victim's
saving throw.
If the spell recipient fails his saving
throw, he regards the caster as a tnisted
friend and ally to be heeded and protected.
The spell does not enable the caster to con-
trol the charmed creature as if it were an
automaton, but any word or action of the
caster is viewed in the most favorable way.
Thus, a charmed person would not obey a
suicide command, but he might believe the
caster if assured that the only chance to save
the caster's life is for the person to hold back
an onrushing red dragon for "just a round or
two." Note also that the spell does not
endow the caster with linguistic capabilities
beyond those he normally possesses (i.e., he
must speak the victim's language to commu-
nicate his commands).
The duration of the spell is a function of
the charmed person's lntelligence and is tied
to the saving throw. The spell may be bro-
ken if a successful saving throw is rolled.
and this saving throw is checked on a peri-
odic basis, according to the creature's Intel-
ligence (see the following table). lf the caster
harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed
person by some overt action, or if a dispel
magic spell is successfully cast upon the
charmed person, the charm spell is broken.
lf two or more charm effects simultane-
ously affect a creature, the result is decided
by the DM. This could range from one effect
being clearly dominant, to the subject being
tom by conﬂicting desires. to new saving
throws that could negate both spells.
Note that the subject has full memory of
the events that took place while he was
channed.

Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: Neg.
When the caster completes this spell, a
blue glow encompasses his hand. This
energy attacks the life force of any living
creature upon which the wizard makes a
successful melee attack. The touched crea-
ture must roll a successful saving throw vs.
spell or suffer 1d4 points of damage and lose
1 point of Strength. lf the save is successful,
the creature remains unhan-ned. Creatures
not rated for Strength suffer a - 1 penalty to
their attack rolls for every other successful
touch. Lost Strength retums at the rate of 1
point per hour. Damage must be cured mag-
ically or healed naturally.
This spell has a special effect on undead
creatures. Undead touched by the caster suf-
fer no damage or Strength loss. but they
must successfully save vs. spell or flee for

Reversible
Range: Touch
Components: V. S, M
Duration: 5 rounds/ level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 speaking creature or
written object
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, the wizard is able
to understand the spoken words of a crea-
ture or read an otherwise incomprehensible
written message (such as writing in another
language). ln either case, the wizard must
touch the creature or the writing. Note that
the ability to read does not necessarily
impart understanding of the material, nor
does the spell enable the caster to speak or
write an unknown language. Written mate-
rial can be read at the rate of one page or
equivalent per round. Magical writing can-
not be read, other than to know it is magi-
cal. but the spell is often useful when
deciphering treasure maps. This spell can be
foiled by certain warding magics (the 3rd-
level secret page and illusionary script
spells) and it does not reveal messages con-
cealed in otherwise normal text.
The material components of this spell are
a pinch of soot and a few grains of salt.

es, cancels a comprehend languages spell or
renders a writing or a creature's speech

Components: V, S. M
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
When a dancing lights spell is cast, the
wizard creates, at his option, from one to
four lights that resemble either torches or
lanterns (and cast that amount of light),
glowing spheres of light (such as evidenced
by will-o-wisps), or one faintly glowing.
vaguely man-like shape, somewhat similar
to that of a creature from the elemental
plane of Fire. The dancing lights move as the
spellcaster desires, forward or back,
straight or turning comers, without concen-
tration upon such movement by the wizard.
The spell cannot be used to cause blindness
(see 1st-level light spell), and it winks out if
the range or duration is exceeded.
The material component of this spell is
either a bit of phosphorus or wychwood, or
a glowworm.

Area of Effect: 10' path, 60' long
Saving Throw: None
When the detect magic spell is cast, the
wizard detects magical radiations in a path
10 feet wide and up to 60 feet long, in the
direction he is facing. The intensity of the
magic can be determined (dim, faint, mod-
erate, strong, overwhelming), and the wiz-
ard has a 10% chance per level to recognize
if a certain type of magic (alteration, conju-
ration, etc.) is present. The caster can turn.
scanning a 60-degree arc per round. A stone
wall of one foot or more thickness, solid
metal of one inch thickness, or a yard or
more of solid wood blocks the spell. Magi-
cal areas. multiple types of magic, or strong
local magical emanations may confuse or
conceal weaker radiations. Note that this
spell does not reveal the presence of good or
evil, or reveal alignment. Other-planar
creatures are not necessarily magical.
Detect Undead
(Divination, Necromancy)
Range: 0
Components: V, S. M
Duration: 3 tums

This spell enables the caster to detect all
undead creatures out to the range of the
spell. The area of effect extends in a path 10
feet wide and 60 feet long (plus 10 feet long-
er per level of the wizard), in the direction
the caster is facing. Scanning a direction
requires one round. and the caster must be
motionless. While the spell indicates direc-
tion, it does not give specific location or dis-
tance. lt detects undead through walls and
obstacles but is blocked by one foot of solid
stone, one yard of wood or loose earth, or a
thin coating of metal. The spell does not
indicate the type of undead detected, only
that undead are present.
The material component for this spell is a
bit of earth from a grave.

Enlarge (Alteration)
Reversible
Range: 5 yardsl level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 5 rounds/ level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 aeature or object
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell causes instant growth of a crea-
ture or object, increasing both size and
weight. lt can be cast only upon a single
creature (or a symbiotic or community enti-
ty) or upon a single object that does not
exceed ten cubic feet in volume per caster
level. The object or creature must be seen to
be affected. lt grows by up to 10% per level
of experience of the wizard, increasing this
amount in height. width, and weight.
All equipment wom or carried by a crea-
ture is enlarged by the spell. Unwilling vic-
tims are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell.
A successful saving throw means the spell
fails. lf insufficient room is available for the
desired growth, the creature or object
attains the maximum possible size. bursting
weak enclosures in the process, but it is con-
strained without harm by stronger
materials—the spell cannot be used to crush
a creature by growth.
Magical properties are not increased by
this spell—a huge sword 4-1 is still only +1,
a staff-sized wand is still only capable of its
normal functions, a giant-sized potion
merely requires a greater fluid intake to
make its magical effects operate, etc.
Weight, mass, and strength are affected,
though, Thus, a table blocking a door
would be heavier and more effective, a
hurled stone would have more mass (and
cause more damage), chains would be more
massive, doors thicker, a thin line tumed to
a sizeable, longer rope. and so on. A crea-
ture's hit points, Armor Class, and attack
rolls do not change. but damage rolls
increase proportionately with size. For
example, a fighter at 160% normal size hits
with his long sword and rolls a 6 for dam-
age. The adjusted damage roll is 10 (that is,
6 x 1.6 = 9.6, rounded up). Bonuses due to
Strength, class, and magic are not altered.
The reverse spell, reduce, negates the
enlarge spell or makes creatures or objects
smaller. The creature or object loses 10% of
its original size for every level of the caster,
to a minimum of 10% of the original size.
Thereafter, the size shrinks by one-foot
increments to less than one foot, by one-
inch increments to one inch, and by Vio-
inch increments to a minimum of ‘/in of an
inch-the recipient cannot dwindle away to
nothingness. For example, a 16-foot-tall
giant reduced by a 15th-level wizard (15
steps) would be reduced to 1.6 feet (in nine
steps). then to °/to of a foot or 7.2 inches (in
one step), and finally to 2.2 inches (in the



last five Steps). A shrinking object may
damage weaker materials affixed to it. but
an object will shrink only as long as the ob-
ject itself is not damaged. Unwilling crea-
tures are allowed a saving throw vs, spell.
The material component of this spell is a
pinch of powdered iron.

The erase spell removes writings of either
magical or mundane nature from a scroll or
from one to two pages of paper, parchment,
or similar surfaces. lt removes explosive
runes, glyphs of warding, sepia snake sigils.
and wizard marks, but it does not remove il-
lusory script or symbols (see these spells).
Nonmagical writings are automatically
erased if the caster is touching them, other-
wise the chance for success is 90%. Magical
writings must be touched, and are only 30%
likely to be erased, plus 5% per caster level,

Duration; 1 roundl level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect; Special
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, the creature(s) or
obiect(s) affected immediately assumes the
mass of a piece of down. Rate of falling is in-
stantly changed to a mere two feet per sec-
ond (12O feet per round), and no damage is
incurred upon landing while the spell is in
effect. However, when the spell duration
ceass, normal rate of fall occurs. The spell
can be cast upon the wizard or some other
creature or object up to the maximum range
and lasts for one round for each level of the
wizard. The feather full affects one or more
objects or creatures in a 10-foot cube, as
long as the maximum weight of the crea-
tures or objects does not exceed a combined
total of 200 pounds plus 200 pounds per
level of the spellcaster.
For example, a Znd~level wizard has a
range of Z0 yards. a duration of two rounds,
and a weight limit of 600 pounds when cast-
ing this spell. The spell works only upon
free-falling, flying, or propelled objects
(such as missiles). lt does not affect a sword
blow or a charging creature. Note that the
spell can be effectively combined with gust
of wind and similar spells.

creatures, such as cats, frogs, ferrets, crows,
hawks, snakes, owls, ravens, toads, wea-
sels. or even mice. A creature acting as a fa-

at a time, however, and he has no control
over what sort of creature answers the sum-
moning, if any at all come.
The creature is always more intelligent
than others of its type (typically 2 or 3 lnt
points), and its bond with the wiurd con-
fers upon it an exceptionally long life. The
wizard receives the heightened senses of his
familiar, which grants the wizard a + 1 bo-
nus to all surprise die rolls. Normal famil-
iars have 2-4 hit points plus 1 hit point per
caster level, and an Armor Class of 7 (due to
size, speed, etc.).
The wizard has an empathic link with the
familiar and can issue it mental commands
at a distance of up to one mile. Note that
empathic responses from the familiar are
generally fairly basic—while able to com-
municate simple thoughts, these are often
overwhelmed by instinctual responses.
Thus a ferret familiar spying on a band of
orcs in the woods might lose its train of
thought upon sighting a mouse. Certainly
its communications to its master would be
tinged with fear of the "big ones" it was spy-
ing onl The caster cannot see through the fa-
miliar's eyes.
If separated from the caster, the familiar
loses 1 hit point each day, and dies if re-
duced to 0 hit points. When the familiar is in
physical contact with its wizard, it gains the
wizard's saving throws against special at-
tacks. If a special attack would normally
cause damage, the familiar suffers no dam-
age if the saving throw is successful and half
damage if the saving throw is failed. if the
familiar dies, the wizard must successfully
roll an immediate system shock check or
die. Even if he survives this check, the wiz-
ard loses 1 point from his Constitution
when the familiar dies.
The power of the coniuration is such that
it can be attempted but once per year. When
the wizard decides to find a familiar, he
must load a brass brazier with charcoal.
When this is buming well, he adds 1,000 gp
worth of incense and herbs. The spell incan-
tation is then begun and must be continued
I34
until the familiar comes or the casting time
is finished. The DM secretly determines all
results. Note that most familiars are not in-
herently magical, nor does a dispel magic
spell send them away.
Deliberate mistreatment, failure to feed
and care for the familiar, or continuous un-
reasonable demands have adverse effects on
the familiar's relationship with its master.
Purposely arranging the death of one's own
familiar incurs great disfavor from certain
powerful entities, with dire results.

friends (Enchantment/Charm)
Range: O
Components: V, 5, M
Duration: 1d4 rounds + 1 round/ level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 60-foot radius
Saving Throw: Special
A friends spell causes the wizard to tem-
porarily gain 2d4 points of Charisma, intel-
ligent creatures within the area of effect at
the time the spell is cast must make immedi-
ate reaction checks based on the character's
new Charisma. Those with favorable reac-
tions tend to be very impressed with the
spellcaster and make an effort to be his
friends and help him, as appropriate to the
situation. Off-icious bureaucrats might de-
cide to become helpful; surly gate guards
might wax informative; attacking orcs
might spare the caster's life, taking him cap-
tive instead. When the spell wears off, the
creatures realize that they have been influ-
enced, and their reactions are determined by
the DM.
The components for this spell are chalk
(or white flour), lampblack (or soot), and
vermilion applied to the face before casting
the spell.



Gaze Reﬂection (Alteration)
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 2 rounds -it 1 roundl level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
The gaze reflection spell creates a shim-
mering, mirror-like area of air before the
wizard that moves with the caster. Any gaze
attack, such as that of a basilisk, eyes of
charming, a vampire's gaze, the 6th-level
eyebite spell, and so on, is reﬂected back
upon the gazer if the gazer tries to make eye
contact with the spellcaster (the spellcaster
suffers no effects from the gaze attack).
Such creatures receive a saving throw vs.
their own gaze effect. The spell does not
affect vision or lighting and is not effective
against creatures whose effect comes from
being gazed upon (such as a medusa). Only
active gaze attacks are blocked by this spell.
Grease (Conjuration)
Range: 10 yards
Components: V. 5. M
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 10' X 10' square area
Saving Throw: Special
A grease spell covers a material surface
with a slippery layer of a fatty, greasy
nature. Any creature entering the area or
caught in it when the spell is cast must save
vs. spell or slip, skid. and fall. Those who
successfully save can reach the nearest non-
grensed surface by the end of the round.
Those who remain in the area are allowed a
saving throw each round until they escape
the area. The DM should adjust saving
throws by circumstance; for example, a
creature charging down an incline that is
suddenly greased has little chance to avoid
the effect, but its ability to exit the affected
area is almost assured! The spell can also be
used to create a greasy coating on an item-
a rope, ladder rungs, weapon handle, etc.
Material obiects not in use are always
affected by this spell, while creatures wield-
ing or employing items receive a saving
throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. If the ini-
tial saving throw is failed, the creature
immediately drops the item. A saving throw
must be made each round the creature
attempts to use the greased item. The caster
can end the effect with a single utterance;
otherwise it lasts for three rounds plus one
round per level.
The material component of the spell is a
bit of pork rind or butter.
Wizard Spells ( I st level) .
Hold Portal (Alteration)
Range: Z0 yardsl level
Component: V
Duration: 1 round/ level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Z0 square feet/ level
Saving Throw: None
This spell magically bars a door, gate, or
valve of wood, metal, or stone. The magical
closure holds the portal fast, iust as if it were
securely closed and locked. Any extra-
planar creature (diinn, elemental, etc.) with
4 or more Hit Dice can shatter the spell and
burst open the portal. A wizard of 4 or more
experience levels higher than the spellcaster
can open the held portal at will. A knock
spell or a successful dispel magic spell can
negate the hold portal. Held portals can be
broken or physically battered down.
Hypnotlsm (Enchantment/Charm)
Range: 5 yards
Components: V. S
Duration: 1 round + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 30-foot cube
Saving Throw: Neg.
The gestures of the wizard, along with his
droning incantation. cause 1cl6 creatures
within the area to become susceptible to a
suggestion-a brief and reasonable-
sounding request (see the 3rd-level wizard
suggestion spell). The request must be given
after the hypnotism spell is cast. Until that
time the success of the spell is unknown.
Note that the subsequent suggestion is not a
spell, but simply a vocalized urging (the
caster must speak a language the creature
understands for this spell to work). Crea-
tures that successfully roll their saving
throws are not under hypnotic inﬂuence.
Those who are exceptionally wary or hostile
save with +1 to +3 bonuses. lf the spell is
cast at‘an individual creature that meets the
caster's gaze, the saving throw is made with
a penalty of -2. A creature that fails its sav-
ing throw does not remember that the caster
enspelled it.
Identify (Divination)
Range: O
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: 1 item/level
Saving Throw: None
l/Vhen an identify spell is cast, magical
items subsequently touched by the wizard
can be identified. The eight hours immedi-
ately preceding the casting of the spell must
be spent purifying the items and removing
inﬂuences that would corrupt and blur their
I35
magical auras. lf this period is interrupted.
it must be begun again. When the spell is
cast, each item must be handled in tum by
the wizard. Any consequences of this han-
dling fall fully upon the wizard and may end
the spell, although the wizard is allowed
any applicable saving throw.
The chance of learning a piece of informa-
tion about an item is equal to 10% per level
of the caster, to a maximum of 90%, rolled
by the DM. Any roll of 96-O0 indicates a
false reading (91-95 reveals nothing). Only
one function of a multi-function item is dis-
covered per handling (i.e., a 5th-level wiz-
ard could attempt to determine the nature of
five different items. five different fimctions
of a single item, or any combination of the
two). lf any attempt at reading fails, the
caster cannot learn any more about that
item until he advances a level. Note that
some items. such as special magical tomes,
cannot be identified with this spell.
The item never reveals its exact attack or
damage bonuses, although the fact that it has
few or many bonuses can be determined. If it
has charges, only a general indication of the
number of charge remaining is learned: pow-
erful (81%~100% of the total possible
charges), strong (61 %-80%). moderate (41%-
6O%). weak (6%—40%). or faint (five charges
or less). The faint result takes precedence, so a
fully charged ring of three wisl-is always
appears to be only faintly charged.
After casting the spell and determining
what can be learned from it, the wizard
loses 8 points of Constitution. He must rest
for one hour to recover each point of Con-
stitution. If the 8-point loss drops the spell-
caster below a Constitution of 1, he falls
unconscious. Consciousness is not regained
until full Constitution is restored, which
takes 24 hours (one point per three hours for
an unconscious character).
The material components of this spell are
a pearl (of at least 100 gp value) and an owl
feather steeped in wine, with the infusion
drunk prior to spellcasting. If a luckstone is
powdered and added to the infusion, the
divination becomes much more potent:
exact bonuses or charges can be determined.
and the functions of a multi-functional item
can be leamed from a single reading. At the
DM's option, certain properties of an arti-
fact or relic might also be leamed.
|ump (Alteration)
Range: Touch
Components: V. S, M
Du.ration: 1d3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
The individual touched when this spell is
cast is empowered to leap once per round
for the duration of the spell. Leaps can be up



to 30 feet forward or straight upward or 10
feet backward. Horizontal leaps forward or
backward have only a slight arc—about
two feet per 10 feet of distance traveled. The
jump spell does not ensure safety in landing
or grasping at the end of the leap.
The material component of this spell is a
grasshoppers hind leg, to be broken by the
caster when the spell is cast.
Light (Alteration)
Range: 60 yards
Components: V, M
Duration: 1 tum/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 20-foot-radius globe
Saving Throw: Special
This spell creates a luminous glow, equal
to torchlight, within a fixed radius of the
spell's center. Objects in darkness beyond
this sphere can be seen, at best, as vague and
shadowy shapes. The spell is centered on a
point selected by the caster, and he must
have a line of sight and unobstructed path
for the spell when it is cast. Light can spring
from air, rock, metal, wood, or almost any
similar substance.
The effect is immobile unless it is specifi-
cally centered on a moveable object or
mobile creature. lf this spell is cast upon a
creature, the applicable magic resistance
and saving throw rolls must be made. Suc-
cessful resistance negates the spell, while a
successful saving throw indicates that the
spell is centered immediately behind the
creature, rather than upon the creature
itself. Light taken into an area of magical
darkness does not function, but if cast
directly against magical darkness negates it
(but only for the duration of the light spell.
if the darkness effect is continual).
Light centered on the visual organs of a
creature blinds it, reducing its attack rolls
and saving throws by 4 and worsening its
Annor Class by 4. The caster can end the
spell at any time by uttering a single word.
The material component is a firefly or a
piece of phosphorescent moss.
Magic Mlsslle tlivocation)
Range: 60 yards + 10 yards/level
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 or more creatures
in a '10-foot cube
Saving Throw: None
Use of the magic missile spell creates up to
five missiles of magical energy that dart
forth from the wizard's fingertip and unerr-
ingly strike their target. This includes ene-
my creatures in a melee. The target creature
must be seen or otherwise detected to be hit,
however, so near-total concealment. such as
that offered by arrow slits, can render the
spell ineffective. Likewise, the caster must
be able to identify the target. He cannot
direct a magic missile to "Strike the com-
mander of the legion," unless he can single
out the commander from the rest of the sol-
d.iers. Specific parts of a creature cannot be
singled out. inanimate objects (locks, etc.)
cannot be damaged by the spell, and any
attempt to do so wastes the missiles to no
effect. Against creatures, each missile
inflicts 1d4 +1 points of damage.
For every two extra levels of experience,
the wizard gains an additional missile—he
has two at 3rd level, three at Sth level, four
at 7th level, etc., up to a total of five missiles
at 9th level. If the wizard has multiple mis-
sile capability, he can have them strike a sin-
gle target creature or several creatures, as
desired.
Mending (Alteration)
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, 5, M
Duration: Pemianent
Casting Time: I
Area of Effect: l object
Saving Throw: None
This spell repairs small breaks or tears in
objects. lt will weld a broken ring, chain
link, medallion, or slender dagger, provid-
ing but one break exists. Ceramic or wood-
en objects with multiple breaks can be
invisibly rejoined to be as strong as new. A
hole in a leather sack or wineskin is com-
pletely healed over by a mending spell. This
spell does not, by itself, repair magical items
of any type. One tum after the spell is cast,
the magic of the joining fades, and the effect
cannot be magically dispelled. The maxi-
mum volume of material the caster can
mend is one cubic foot per level.
The material components of this spell are
two small magnets of any type (lodestone in
all likelihood) or two burrs.
Message (Alteration)
Range: 0
Components: V, S. M
Duration: 5 rounds/ level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, the wizard can
whisper messages and receive replies with
little chance of being overheard. When the
spell is cast, the wizard secretly or openly
points his finger at each creature to be
included in the spell effect. Up to one crea-
ture per level can be included. When the
wizard whispers, the whispered message
travels in a straight line and is audible to all
of the involved creatures within 30 feet, plus
IO feet per level of the caster. The creatures
I36
who receive the message can whisper a reply
that is heard by the spellcaster. Note that
there must be an unobstnicted path between
the spellcaster and the recipients of the spell.
The message must be in a language the cast-
er speaks; this spell does not by itself confer
understanding upon the recipients. This
spell is most often used to conduct quick
and private conferences when the caster
does not wish to be overheard.
The material component of the spell is a
short piece of copper drawn fine.
Mount (Conluration/Summoning)
Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 hours + 1 hour/level
Casting Time: 1 tum
Area of Effect: 1 mount
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell. the caster conjures
a normal animal to serve him as a mount.
The animal serves willingly and well, but at
the expiration of the spell duration it disap-
pears, retuming to its own place. The type
of mount gained by this spell depends on the
level of the caster: of course, a caster can
choose a lesser mount if desired. Available
mounts include the following:
Caster Level
1st-3rd level
4th-7th level
Mount
Mule or light horse
Draft horse or
war horse
Camel
Elephant (and
howdah at 18th level)
Griffon (and saddle at
18th level)
The mount does not come with any riding
gear, unless it is of a class lower than the
caster would normally be entitled to; thus a
4th-level wizard can gain a war horse with-
out saddle and harness, or a light horse with
saddle and hamess. The statistics of the ani-
mal gained are typical of all creatures of the
same class. The mount disappears when
slain.
The material component of the spell is a
bit of hair from the type of animal to be con-
jured.
8th-12th level
13th-14th level
15th level 8: up
Nystul's Magical Aura
(Illusion/Phantasm)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 day/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special
By means of this spell, any one item of no
more than five pounds weight per level of
the spellcaster can be given an aura that is



noticed by someone using magic detection.
Furthermore, the caster can specify the type
of magical aura that is detected (alteration.
conjuration, etc.) and this effectively masks
the item's actual aura, if any, unless the
item's own aura is exceptionally powerful (if
it is an artifact, for instance). lf the object
bearing Nystuls magical aura has an iden-
tify spell cast on it or is similarly examined.
the examiner has a 50% chance of recogniz-
ing that the aura has been placed to mislead
the unwary. Otherwise, the aura is believed
and no amount of testing reveals what the
true magic is.
The component for this spell is a small
square of silk, which must be passed over
the object that receives the aura.
Phantasmal force (Illusion/Phantasm)
Range: 60 yards + 10 yards/level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 400 sq. ft. + 100 sq. ft./level
Saving Throw: Special
This spell creates the illusion of any
object, creature, or force. as long as it is
within the boundaries of the spell's area of
effect. The illusion is visual and affects all
believing creatures (undead are immune)
that view it. lt does not create sound, smell,
or temperature. Effects that depend on these
senses usually fail. The illusion lasts until
struck by an opponent—unless the spell-
caster causes the illusion to react
appropriately—or until the wizard ceases
concentration upon the spell (due to desire.
moving, or a successful attack that causes
damage). Saving throws for illusions are
explained under Illusion in the Magic chap-
ter (Page 80) and on page 130. Creatures
that disbelieve the illusion see it for what it
is and add +4 to associates’ saving throws if
this knowledge can be communicated effec-
tively. Creatures believing the illusion are
subject to its effects, again as explained
under Illusions.
The illusionary effect can be moved by
the caster within the limits of the area-of
effect. The DM has to rule on the effective
ness of this spell: detailed guidelines are out-
lined on page 130 and in Chapter 7: Magic.
The material component of the spell is a
bit of ﬂeece.

Wizard Spells (lst Level) "
Protection from ivll (Ahjuntion)
Reversible
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, it creates a magical
barrier around the recipient at a distance of
one foot. The barrier moves with the recipi-
ent and has three major effects:
First, all attacks made by evil (or evilly
enchanted) creatures against the protected
creature suffer -2 penalties to attack rolls:
any saving throws caused by such attacks
are made with +2 bonuses.
Second, any attempt to possess (as by a
magic far attack) or to exercise mental con-
trol over (as by a vampire's charm ability)
the protected creature is blocked by this
spell. Note that the protection does not pre-
vent a vampire's charm itself, but it does
prevent the exercise of mental control
through the barrier. Likewise, a possessing
life force is merely kept out. lt would not be
expelled if in place before the protection is
cast.
Third, the spell prevents bodily contact
by creatures of an extraplanar or conjured
nature (such as aerial servants, elementals.
imps, invisible stalkers, salamanders, water
weirds, xom, and others). This causes the
natural (body) weapon attacks of such crea-
tures to fail and the creatures to recoil, if
such attacks require touching the protected
being. Animals or monsters summoned or
conjured by spells or similar magic are like-
wise hedged from the character.
This protection ends if the protected char-
acter makes a melee attack against or tries to
force the barrier against the blocked crea-
ture.
To complete this spell, the wizard must
trace a three-toot-diameter circle on the
floor (or ground) with powdered silver.
This spell can be reversed to become pro-
tection from good; the second and third
beneﬁts remaining unchanged. The material
component for the reverse is a circle of pow-
dered iron.
Read Magic (Divination)
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
By means of a read magic spell, the wiz-
ard is able to read magical inscriptions on
objects—books, scrolls, weapons, and the
like—that would otherwise be totally unin-
telligible. (The personal books of the wiz-
I31
ard, and works already magically read, are
intelligible.) This deciphering does not nor-
mally invoke the magic contained in the
writing, although it may do so in the case of
a cursed scroll. Furthermore, once the spell
is cast and the wizard has read the magical
inscription, he is thereafter able to read that
particular writing without recourse to the
use of the read magic spell. The duration of
the spell is two rounds per level of experi-
ence of the spellcaster; the wizard can read
one page or its equivalent per round.
The wizard must have a clear crystal or
mineral prism, which is not expended. to
cast the spell.
Shield (Evocation)
Range: 0
Components: V. S
Duration: 5 rounds! level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, an invisible barrier
comes into being in front of the wizard. This
shield totally negates magic missile attad<s.
lt provides the equivalent protection of AC
2 against hand-hurled missiles (axes, darts,
javelins, spears, etc.). AC 3 against small
device-propelled missiles (arrows. bolts.
bullets, manticore spikes, sling stones, etc.),
and AC 4 against all other forrns of attack.
The shield also adds a +1 bonus to the wiz-
ard's saving throws against attacks that are
basically frontal. Note that these benefits
apply only if the attacks originate from in
front of the wizard, where the shield can
move to inter-pose itself.
Shocking Grasp (Allefiﬂﬂn)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
When the wizard casts this spell, he
develops a powerful electrical charge that
gives a jolt to the creature touched. The
spell remains in effect for one round per
level of the caster or until it is discharged by
the caster touching another creature. The
shocking grasp delivers 1d8 points of dam-
age, plus 1 point per level of the wizard
(e.g., a 2nd-level wizard would discharge a
shock causing 1d8+2 points of damage).
While the wizard must come close enough
to his opponent to lay a hand on the oppo-
nent's body or upon an electrical conductor
that touches the opponent's body, a like
touch from the opponent does not discharge
the spell.



Sleep (Endiantment/Charm)
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration; 5 rounds/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
When a wizard casts a sleep spell, he
causes a comatose slumber to come upon
one or more creatures (other than undead
and certain other creatures specifically
excluded from the spell's effects). All crea-
tures to be affected by the sleep spell must be
within 30 feet of each other. The number of
creatures that can be affected is a function of
Hit Dice or levels. The spell affects Zcl-1 Hit
Dice of monsters. Monsters with 4+3 Hit
Dice (4 Hit Dice plus 3 hit points) or more
are unaffected. The center of the area of
effect is determined by the spellcaster. The
creatures with the least Hit Dice are affected
first, and partial effects are ignored.
For example, a wizard casts sleep at three
kobolds, two gnolls, and an ogre. The roll
(2d4) result is 4. All the kobolds and one
gnollareaffected('/z + ‘/1 + 1/z + 2 = 3*/z
Hit Dice). Note that the remainder is not
enough to affect the last gnoll or the ogre.
Slapping or wounding awakens affected
creatures but normal noise does not. Awak-
ening requires one entire round. Magically
sleeping opponents can be attacked with
substantial bonuses (see Combat, page 90).
The material component for this spell is a
pinch of fine sand, rose petals, or a live
cricket.
Spider Climb (Alteration)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Neg.
A spider climb spell enables the recipient
to climb and travel upon vertical surfaces as
well as a giant spider, or even hang upside
down from ceilings. Unwilling victims must
be touched and are then allowed a saving
throw vs. spell to negate the effect. The
affected creature must have bare hands and
feet in order to climb in this manner. at a
movement rate of 6 (3 if at all encumbered).
During the course of the spell, the recipient
cannot handle objects that weigh less than a
dagger (one pound), for such objects stick to
his hands and feet. Thus a wizard will find it
virtually impossible to cast spells if under a
spider climb spell. Sufficient force can pull
the recipient free; the DM can assign a sav-
ing throw based on circumstances, the
strength of the force. and so on. For exam-
ple. a creature with a Strength of 12 might
pull the subject free if the subject fails a sav-
ing throw vs. paralyzation (a moderately
difficult saving throw). The caster can end
the spell effect with a word.
The material components of this spell are
a drop of bitumen and a live spider, both of
which must be eaten by the spell recipient.
Spook (Illusion/Phantumi)
Range: (3
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature within 30 feet
Saving Throw: Neg.
A spook spell enables the wizard to play
upon natural fears to cause the target crea-
ture to perceive the spellcaster as someone
or something inimical. Without actually
knowing what this is, the wizard merely
advances threateningly upon the creature. lf
a successful saving throw vs. spell is not
made, the creature turns and flees at maxi-
mum speed as far from the wizard as possi-
ble, though items carried are not dropped.
The creature has a saving throw penalty of
-1 for every two experience levels of the
the caster, to a maximum of -6 at 12th
level. Note that a natural (unmodiﬁed) roll
of Z0 automatically succeeds, regardless of
saving throw penalties. Although the caster
does not actually pursue the ﬂeeing crea-
ture. a phantasm from its own mind does.
Each round after the initial casting, the crea-
ture receives another saving throw, without
penalty, until it successfully saves and the
spell is broken. In any event, the spell func-
tions only against creatures with Intelli-
gences of 2 or more, and undead are not
affected at all.
Taunt (Enchantment)
Range: 60 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 30-foot radius
Saving Throw: Neg.
A taunt spell enables the caster to jape
and jeer effectively at a single type of crea-
ture with an lntelligence of 2 or greater. The
caster need not speak the language of the
creatures. His words and sounds have real
meaning for the subject creature or crea-
tures: challenging, insulting, and generally
irritating and angering the listeners. Those
failing to save vs. spell rush forth in fury to
do battle with the spellcaster. All affected
creatures attack the spellcaster in melee if
physically capable of doing so, seeking to
use body or hand-held weapons rather than
missile weapons or spells. Separation of the
caster from the victim by an impenetrable
or uncrossable boundary (a wall of fire. a
deep chasm, a fonnation of set pikemen)
I38
causes the spell to break. lf the caster taunts
a mixed group, he must choose the type of
creature to be affected. Creatures com-
manded by a strong leader (i.e., with a Cha-
risma bonus, with higher Hit Dice, etc.)
might gin a saving throw bonus of +1 to
+4. at the DM's discretion. If used in con-
junction with a ventriloquism spell. the
creatures may attack the apparent source,
depending upon their Intelligence, a leader's
presence, and so on.
The material component is a slug, which
is hurled at the creatures to be taunted.
‘l’enser's floating Dlsc (I-Zvocation)
Range: 20 yarck
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 3 turns + 1 tum/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
With this spell, the caster creates the
slightly concave. circular plane of force
knovtm as Tenser's ﬂoating disc (after the
famed wizard whose greed and ability to
locate treasure are well known). The disc is
three feet in diameter and holds 100 pounds
of weight per level of the wizard casting the
spell. The disc ﬂoats at approximately three
feet above the ground at all times and
remains level. It ﬂoats along horizontally
within its range of 20 yards at the command
of the caster, and will accompany him at a
movement rate of no more than 6. If
unguided, it maintains a constant interval of
six feet between itself and the wizard. lf the
spellcaster moves beyond range (by moving
faster, or by such means as a teleport spell,
or by trying to take it more than three feet
from the surface beneath it), or if the spell
duration expires, the floating disc winks out
of existence and whatever it was supporting
crashes to the surface beneath it.
The material component of the spell is a
drop of mercury.
Unseen Servant
(ConjurationISununoni|tg)
Range: O
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 hour + 1 tum/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 30-foot radius
Saving Throw: None
The unseen servant is a non-visible.
mindless, and shapeless force. used to step
and fetch, open unstuck doors, and hold
chairs, as well as to clean and mend. lt is not
strong, but unfailingly obeys the command
of the wizard. lt can carry out only one
activity at a time and can move only light-
weight items—carry a maximum of 20
pounds or push or pull 40 pounds across a



smooth surface. It can open only normal
doors, drawers, lids, etc. The unseen ser-
vant cannot fight, nor can it be killed, as it is
a force rather than a creature. lt can be mag-
ically dispelled, or eliminated after receiv-
ing 6 points of damage from area-effect
spells, breath weapons, or similar attacks. if
the caster attempts to send it beyond the
allowed radius, the spell ends immediately.
The material components of the spell are
a piece of string and a bit of wood.
Ventrlloqulslll (Illusion/Phaiimm)
Range: 10 yards/level, maximum 90 yards
Components: V, M
Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature or object
Sailing Throw: Special
This spell enables the wizard to make his
voice—or someone else's voice—or a simi-
lar sound seem to issue from someplace else,
such as from another creature, a statue.
from behind a door, down a passage, etc.
The spellcaster can speak in any language
that he knows, or make any sound that he
can normally make. With respect to such
voices and sounds, anyone rolling a success-
ful saving throw vs. spell with a - 2 penalty
detects the ruse. If cast in conjunction with
other illusions, the DM may rule greater
penalties or disallow an independent saving
throw against this spell in consideration of
its contribution to the total effect of the
combined illusion.
The material component of this spell is a
parchment rolled up into a small cone.
Wall of Fog (Evocation)
Range: 30 yards
Components: V. 5, M
Duration: 2d4 rounds ‘F 1 roundl level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 20' cube + 10' cube/level
Saving Throw: None
By casting this spell, the wizard creates a
billowing wall of misty vapors in any area
within the spell range. The wall of fog
obscures all sight, normal and infravision,
beyond two feet. The caster may create less
vapor if he wishes. The wall must be a
roughly cubic or rectangular mass, at least
ten feet wide in its smallest dimension. The
misty vapors persist for three or more
rounds. Their duration can be halved by a
moderate wind, and they can be l3lOW‘l'\
away by a strong wind.
The material component is a pinch of split
dried peas.
Wizard Spells (Znd Level) 
Wizard Mark (Alteration)
Range: Touch
Components: V. S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Up to 1 square foot
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, the wizard is able
to inscribe, visibly or invisibly, his personal
rune or mark, as well as up to six additional
characters of smaller size. A wizard mark
spell enables the caster to etch the rune upon
stone, metal, or any softer substance with-
out harm to the material upon which the
mark is placed. if an invisible mark is made,
a detect magic spell will cause it to glow and
be visible (though not necessarily under-
standable). Detect invisibility, true seeing, a
gem of seeing, or a robe of eyes will likewise
expose an invisible wizard mark. A read
magic spell will reveal the maker's words, if
any. The mark cannot be dispelled, but it
can be removed by the caster or by an erase
spell. if cast on a living being, normal wear
gradually causes the mark to fade.
The material components for this spell are
a pinch of diamond dust (about 100 gp
worth) and a pigment or pigments for the
coloration of the mark. If the mark is to be
invisible, the pigments are still used, but the
caster uses a stylus of some sort rather than
his finger.

Second-Level Spells
Alter Self (Alteration)
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 3d4 rounds + 2 roundsl level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, the wizard can
alter his appearance and form—including
clothing and equipment—to appear taller or
shorter; thin, fat, or in between; human,
humanoid. or any other generally man-
shaped bipedal creature. The caster’: body
can undergo a limited physical alteration
and his size can be changed up to 50%. If the
form selected has wings, the wizard can
actually ﬂy, but at only 1/; the speed of a
true creature of that type, and with a loss of
two maneuverability classes (to a minimum
of E). l.f the fomi has gills, the caster can
breathe underwater as long as the spell lasts.
However, any multiple attack routines or
additional damage allowed to an assumed
form are not gained by the caster.
The caster's attack rolls, Armor Class,
and saving throws do not change. The spell
does not confer special abilities, attack
fon-ns, or defenses. Once the new form is
chosen, it remains for the duration of the
spell. The caster can change back into his
own fon'n at will; this ends the spell immedi-
ately. A caster who is slain automatically
retums to his normal form.
Bind (Enchantment)
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is employed, the wizard
can command any non-living ropelike
object, including string, yarn, cord, line,
rope. or even a cable. The spell affects 50
feet of nonnal rope (one-inch diameter).
plus five feet per caster level. This length is
reduced by 50% for every additional inch of
thickness and increases by 50% for each 1/:
inch less. The possible commands are Coil
(form a neat. coiled stack). Coil & Knot,
Loop, Loop k Knot, Tie 5: Knot, and the
reverses of all of the above (Uncoil, etc.).
One command can be given each round.
The rope can only enwrap a creature or
an object within one foot of it—it does not
snake outward—so it must be thrown or
hurled near the intended target. Note that
the rope itself, and any knots tied in it, are
not magical. A typical rope might be AC 6
and take 4 points of slashing damage before
breaking. The rope does not inflict damage



of any type, but it can be used as a trip line
or to entangle a single opponent who fails a
saving throw vs. spell.
Blindness (illusion/Phantasml
Range: 30 yards + 10 yardsl level
Component: V
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.
The blindness spell causes the victim to
become blind, able to see only a grayness
before its eyes. Various cure spells will not
remove this effect, and only a dispel magic
or the spellcaster can do away with the
blindness if the creature fails its initial sav-
ing throw vs. spell. A blinded creature suf-
fers a -4 penalty to its attack rolls, and its
opponents gain a +4 bonus to their attack
rolls.
Ilur (illusion/Fhantasml
Range: O
Components: V, S
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
When a blur spell is cast, the wizard
causes the outline of his form to become
blurred, shifting and wavering. This distor-
tion causes all missile and melee combat
attacks against the caster to be made with
-4 penalties on the first attempt and -2
penalties on all successive attacks. it also
grants the wizard a +1 bonus to his saving
throw for any direct magical attack. A
detect invisibility spell will not counter this
effect, but the Sth-level clerical spell true
seeing and similar magic will.
Continual Light (Alteration)
Reversible
Range: 60 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: Z
Area of Effect: 60-foot radius
Saving Throw: Special
This spell is similar to a light spell, except
that it is as bright as full daylight and lasts
until negated by magical darkness or by a
dispel magic spell. Creatures who suffer
penalties in bright light suffer them in this
spell's area of effect. As with the light spell.
it can be cast into the air, onto an object, or
at a creature. in the third case, the spell af-
fects the space about one foot behind a crea-
ture that successfully rolls its saving throw
vs. spell. Note that this spell can also blind a
creature if it is successfully cast upon the

the creature's attack rolls, saving throws,
and Armor Class by 4. If the spell is cast on
a small object that is then placed in a light-
proof covering, the spell's effects are
blocked until the covering is removed.
A continual light brought into an area of
magical darkness (or vice versa) is tempo-
rarily negated so that the otherwise prevail-
ing light conditions exist in the overlapping
areas of effect. A direct casting of continual
light against a similar or weaker magical
darkness cancels both.
This spell eventually consumes the mate-
rial it is cast upon, but the process takes far
longer than the time in the typical cam-
paign. Extremely hard and expensive mate-
rials can last hundreds or even thousands of
years.
Darkness, I5’ Radius (Alteration)
Range: 10 yardsl level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 15-foot radius
Saving Throw: None
This spell causes total. impenetrable
darkness in the area of effect. lnfravision is
useless. Neither normal nor magical light
works unless a light or continual light spell
is used. in the former event, the darkness
spell is negated by the light spell and vice
versa.
The material components of this spell are
a bit of bat fur and either a drop of pitch or a
piece of coal.
Deafness (illusion/Phantnm)
Range: 60 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.
The deafness spell causes the redpient to
become totally deaf and unable to hear any
sounds. The victim is allowed a saving
throw vs. spell. An affected creature has a
-1 penalty to its surprise rolls unless its
other senses are unusually keen. Deafened
speilcasters have a 20% chance to miscast
any spell with a verbal component. This
deafness can be done away with only by
means of a dispel magic spell or by the spell-
Caster.
The material component of this spell is
beeswax.

Deeppockets (Alteration, Eudmitment)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 12 hours + 1 hour/level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: 1 garment
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the wiurd to specially
prepare a garment so as to hold far more
than it normally could. A finely sewn gown
or robe of high-quality material (at least 50
gp value) is fashioned so as to contain
numerous hand-sized pockets. One dozen is
the minimum number. The deeppockets
spell then enables these pockets to hold a
total of 100 pounds (five cubic feet in vol-
ume) as if it were only 10 pounds of weight.
Furthermore, there are no discemible bulges
where the special pockets are. At the time of
casting, the caster can instead chose to have
10 pockets each holding 10 pounds (1/z
cubic foot volume each). If the robe or like
garment is sewn with 100 or more pockets
(200 gp minimum cost), 100 pockets can be
created to contain one pound of weight and
‘/o cubic foot volume each. Each special
pocket is actually an extradimensional hold-
ing space.
if the spell duration expires while there is
material within the enchanted pockets. or if
a successful dispel magic is cast upon the
enchanted garment. all the material suddm-
ly appears around the wearer and immedi-
ately falls to the ground. The caster can also
cause all the pockets to empty with a single
command.
In addition to the garment, which is reus-
able, the material components of this spell
are a tiny golden needle and a strip of fine
cloth given a half-twist and fastened at the
ends.
Detect Evil (Divination)
Reversible
Range: 60 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: 5 rounds/level
Casting Time: Z
Area of Effect: 10-foot path
Saving Throw: None
This spell discovers emanations of evil (or
of good in the case of the reverse spell) from
any creature, object, or area. Character
alignment is not revealed under most cir-
cumstances: characters who are strongly
aligned, do not stray from their faith, and
who are at least 9th level might radiate good
or evil if they are intent upon appropriate
actions. Powerful monsters, such as ki-rin,
send forth emanations of evil or good, even
if polymorphed. Aligned undead radiate
evil, for it is this power and negative force
that enable them to continue existing. An



evilly cursed object or unholy water radi-
ates evil, but a hidden trap or an unintelli-
gent viper does not. The degree of evil
(faint, moderate, strong, overwhelming)
can be noted. Note that priests have a more
powerful version of this spell.
The spell has a path of detection ten feet
wide in the direction in which the mage is
facing. The wizard must concentrate—st0p.
have quiet, and intently seek to detect the
aura—for at least one round to receive a
reading .
Detect lnvlslblllty (Dtvina tlon)
Range: 10 yards/level
Components: V. S, M
Duration: 5 roundsl level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 10-foot path
Saving Throw: None
When the wizard casts a detect invisibility
spell, he is able to see clearly any objects or
beings that are invisible, as well as any that
are astral, ethereal, or out of phase. ln addi-
tion, it enables the wizard to detect hidden
or concealed creatures (e.g., thieves in
shadows. halflings in underbrush, and so
on). lt does not reveal the method of con-
cealment or invisibility, except in the case of
astral travelers (where the silver cord can be
seen). lt does not reveal illusions or enable
the caster to see through physical objects.
Detection is in the wizard’: line of sight
along a ten-foot-wide path to the range
limit.
The material components of this spell are
a pinch of talc and a small sprinkling of
powdered silver.
ESP (Divination)
Range: 5 yards/level, 90 yards maximum
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: Z
Area of Effect: 1 creature per probe
Saving Throw: None
When an ESP spell is used, the caster is
able to detect the surface thoughts of any
creatures in range—except for those of un-
dead and creatures without minds (as we
know them). The ESP is stopped by two or
more feet of rock, two or more inches of any
metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead
foil. The wizard employing the spell is able
to probe the surface thoughts of one crea-
ture per round, getting simple instinctual
thoughts from lower order creatures.
Probes can continue on the same creature
from round to round or can move on to
other creatures. The caster can use the spell
to help detennine if a creature lurks behind
a door, for example, but the ESP does not al-
ways reveal what sort of creature it is. lf
used as part of a program of interrogation,
I
Wizard Spells (lnd Level) l
an intelligent and wary subject receives an
initial saving throw. lf successful, the crea-
ture successfully resists and the spell reveals
no additional information. lf the saving
throw is failed, the caster may learn addi-
tional information, according to the DM's
niling. The creature's Wisdom adjustment
applies, as may additional bonuses up to
+4, based on the sensitivity of the informa-
tion sought.
The material component of this spell is a
copper piece.
Flaming Sphere (Evocation)
Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect; 3-foot-radius sphere
Saving Throw: Neg.
A flaming sphere spell creates a buming
globe of ﬁre within ten yards of the caster.
This sphere rolls in whichever direction the
wizard points, at a rate of 30 feet per round.
lt rolls over barriers less than four feet tall,
such as furniture, low walls, etc. Flammable
substances are set afire by contact with the
sphere. Creatures in contact with the globe
must successfully save vs. spell or suffer 2d4
points of fire damage. Those within five feet
of the sphere's surface must also save or suf-
fer 1d4 points of heat damage. A successful
saving throw means no damage is suffered.
The DM may adjust the saving throws if
there is little or no room to dodge the
sphere.
The sphere moves as long as the spell-
caster actively directs it, otherwise it merely
stays at rest and bums. lt can be extin-
guished by the same means as any nonnal
fire of its size. The surface of the sphere has
a spongy, yielding consistency and so does
not cause damage except by its ﬂame. lt can-
not push unwilling creatures aside or batter
down large obstacles.
The material components are a bit of tal-
low, a pinch of sulphur, and a dusting of
powdered iron.
Fog Cloud (Alteration)
Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
The fog cloud spell can be cast in either
one of two ways, at the caster's option: as a
large, stationary bank of normal fog, or as a
harmless fog that resembles the 5th-level
wizard spell, cloudkill.
As a fog bank, this spell creates a fog of
any size and shape up to a maximum 20-foot
cube per caster level. The fog obscures all
I4-I
sight, nomial and infravision, beyond two
feet.
As a cloudkill-like fog, this is a billowing
mass of ghastly, yellowish-green vapors.
measuring 40' x 20' x 20‘. This moves away
from the caster at ten feet per round. The
vapors are heavier than air and sink to the
lowest level, even pouring doum sinkholes
and den openings. Very thick vegetation
breaks up the fog after it has moved Z0 feet
into the vegetation.
The only effect of either version is to ob-
snire vision. A strong breeze will disperse
either effect in one round, while a moderate
breeze will reduce the spell duration by
50%. The spell cannot be cast underwater.
fools‘ Gold (Alteration, Illusion)
Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 hour/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 10 cu. in./level
Saving Throw: Special
Copper coins can temporarily be changed
to gold pieces, or brass items turned to solid
gold. for the spell duration by means of this
magic. The area of effect is ten cubic inches
per level—i.e., a 1" x 1” x 10" volume or
equivalent, equal to about 150 gold coins.
Any creature viewing the "gold" is entitled
to a saving throw vs. spell, which can be
modified by the creature's Wisdom; for ev-
ery level of the wizard, the Q-eature must
subtract 1 from his dice roll. Thus it is un-
likely that fools’ gold will be detected if it
was created by a high-level caster. lf the
"gold" is struck hard by an object of cold-
wrought iron, there is a slight chance it will
revert to its natural state, depending on the
material component used to create the
"gold." lf a 25-gp citrine is powdered and
sprinkled over the metal as this spell is cast,
the chance that cold iron will return it to its
true nature is 30%; if a 50-gp amber stone is
powdered and used, there is a 25% chance
that iron will dispel the magic; if a 250-gp
topaz is powdered, the chance drops to
10%; if a 500-gp oriental (conindum) topaz
is powdered, there is only a 1 % chance that
the cold iron will reveal that it is fools‘ gold.

l' Wizard Spells (2nd Level)
forget (Enchantment/Charm)
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 20-foot cube
Saving Throw: Neg.
By means of this spell, the spellcaster
causes creatures within the area of effect to
forget the events of the previous round (the
one minute of time previous to the utterance
of the spell). For every three levels of experi-
ence of the spellcaster, another minute of
past time is forgotten. This does not negate
charm, suggestion, gens, quest, or similar
spells, but it is possible that the being who
placed such magic upon the recipient could
be forgotten. From one to four creatures can
be affected, at the discretion of the caster. If
only one is to be affected, the recipient saves
vs. spell with a -2 penalty; if two, they
save with —1 penalties; if three or four are
to be affected, they save nonnally. All sav-
ing throws are adjusted by Wisdom. A
priest's heal or restoration spell, if specially
cast for this purpose, will restore the lost
memories, as will a limited wish or wish,
but no other means will do so.
Glltterdust (Conluration/Summoning)
Range: 10 yards/level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 20-foot cube
Saving Throw: Special
This spell creates a cloud of glittering
golden particles within the area of effect.
Those in the area must roll a successful sav-
ing throw vs. spell or be blinded ( -'4 penal-
ties to attack rolls, saving throws, and
Armor Class) for 1d4+1 rounds. ln addi-
tion, all within the area are covered by the
dust, which cannot be removed and con-
tinues to sparkle until it fades. Note that this
reveals invisible creatures. The dust fades in
1d4 rounds plus one round per caster level.
Thus glitterdust cast by a 3rd-level wimrd
lasts for four to seven rounds.
The material component is ground mica.
Hypnotic Pattem (Illusion/Phantasm)
Range: 30 yards
Components: S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 30-foot cube
Saving Throw: Neg.
When this spell is cast, the wizard creates
a weaving, twisting pattem of subtle colors
in the air. This pattem causes any creature
looking at it to become fascinated and stand
gazing at it as long as the spellcaster main-
tains the display, plus two rounds there-
after. The spell can captivate a maximum of
24 levels, or Hit Dice, of creatures (e.g., 24
creatures with 1 Hit Die each, 12 with 2 Hit
Dice, etc). All creatures affected must be
within the area of effect. and each is entitled
to a saving throw vs. spell. A damage-
inflicting attack on an affected creature frees
it from the spell immediately.
The mage need not utter a sound, but he
must gesture appropriately while holding a
glowing stick of incense or a crystal rod
filled with phosphorescent material.
Improved Phantasmal Force
(Illusion/Phantasm)
Range: 60 yards + 10 yards/level
Components: V. 5. M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: Z
Area of Effect: 200 sq. ft./ + 50 sq.ft./level
Saving Throw: Special
Like the 1st-level phantasmul force spell,
this spell creates the illusion of any object,
creature, or force, as long as it is within the
spell's area of effect. The spellcaster can
maintain the illusion with minimal concen-
tration, thus he can move at half normal
speed (but not cast other spells). Some mi-
nor sounds are included in the effects of the
spell, but not understandable speech. Also,
the improved phantasm continues for two
rounds after the wizard ceases to concen-
trate upon it.
The material component is a bit of fleece.
lnvlslblllty (Illusion/Phantasm)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: Z
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
This spell causes the creature touched to
vanish from sight and be undetectable by
normal vision or even infravision. Of
course, the invisible creature is not magi-
cally silenced, and certain other conditions
can render the creature detectable. Even al-
lies cannot see the invisible creature or his
gear, unless these allies can normally see in-
visible things or employ magic to do so.
Items dropped or put down by the invisible
creature become visible, items picked up
disappear if tucked into the clothing or
pouches worn by the creature. Note, how-
ever, that light never becomes invisible, al-
though a source of light can become so (thus
the effect is that of a light with no visible
source).
The spell remains in effect until it is magi-
cally broken or dispelled, until the wizard
I41
or recipient cancels it, until the recipient at-
tacks any creature, or until 24 hours have
passed. Thus the invisible being can open
doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, etc., but if he
attacks, he immediately becomes visible, al-
though the invisibility enables him to attack
first. Note that the clerical bless, chant, and
prayer spells are not attacks for this pur-
pose. All highly intelligent (lnt 13 or more)
creatures with 10 or more Hit Dice or levels
of experience have a chance to detect invisi-
ble objects (they roll saving throws vs. spell;
success means they noticed the invisible ob-
ject).
The material components of the invisibil-
ity spell are an eyelash and a bit of gum ara-
bic, the former encased in the latter.
Irritation (Alteration)
Range: 10 yards/level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 to 4 creatures in a 15-foot-
radius area
Saving Throw: Neg.
An irritation spell affects the epidermis of
the subject creatures. Creatures with very
thick or insensitive skins (such as buffalo.
elephants, scaled creatures, etc.) are basi-
cally unaffected by this. There are two ver-
sions of the spell, either of which can be cast
from the standard preparation:
Itching. When cast, this causes each sub-
ject to feel an instant itching sensation on
some portion of its body. lf one round is not
immediately spent scratching the irritated
area, the creature is so affected that the next
three rounds are spent squirming and twist-
ing, effectively worsening its Armor Class by
4 and its attack rolls by 2 during this time.
Spell preparations are ruined in the first
round this spell is in effect. but not in the fol-
lowing three rounds. Doing nothing but
scratching the itch for a full round prevents
the rest of the effect. lf cast at one creature,
the saving throw has a -3 penalty; if cast at
two creatures, the saving throw has a -1
penalty; and if cast at three or four creatures.
the saving throw is normal.
Rash. When a rash is cast, the subject no-
tices nothing for 1d4 rounds, but thereafter
its entire skin breaks out in red welts that
itch. The rash persists until either a cure dis-
ease or dispel magic spell is cast upon it. lt
lowers Charisma by 1 point per day for each
of four days (i.e., maximum Charisma loss
is 4 points). After one week, Dexterity is
lowered by 1 point also. Symptoms vanish
immediately upon the removal of the rash,
and all statistics return to normal. This can
be cast at one creature only, with a saving
throw penalty of -2.
The material component for this spell is a
leaf from poison ivy, oak, or sumac.



Knock (Alteration)
Reversible
Range: 60 yards
Component: V
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 10 square feet/ level
Saving Throw: None
The knock spell opens stuck, barred.
locked, held. or wizard-locked doors. lt
opens secret doors, as well as locked or
trick-opening boxes or chests. It also loos-
ens welds, shackles, or chains. lf used to
open a wizard-locked door, the spell does
not remove the former spell. but simply sus-
pends its functioning for one turn. ln all
other cases, it pennanently opens locks or
welds—although the former could be closed
and locked again later. lt does not raise
barred gates or similar impediments (such as
a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines,
and the like. Note that the effect is limited
by the area; a 3rd-level wizard can knock a
door of 30 square feet or less (e.g., a stand-
ard 4' x 7' door). Each spell can undo up to
two means of preventing egress through a
portal. Thus if a door is locked, barred, and
held, or triple locked, opening it requires
two knock spells. In all cases, the location of
the door or item must be known—the spell
cannot be used against a wall in hopes of
discovering a secret door.
The reverse spell, lock, closes and locks a
door or similar closure, provided there is a
physical mechanism. lt does not create a
weld, but it locks physically operated lock-
ing mechanisms, set bars, and so on, up to
two functions. lt cannot affect a portcullis.
Know Alignment lDivlnati0n)
Reversible
Range: 10 yards
Components: V. S
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 creature or object
per 2 rounds
Saving Throw: Neg.
A know ulignmen! spell enables the wiz-
ard to read the aura of a creature or an
aligned object (unaligned objects reveal
nothing). The caster must remain stationary
and concentrate on the subject for two full
rounds. A creature is allowed a saving
throw vs. spell and, if successful, the caster
learns nothing about that particular crea-
ture from the casting. lf a creature or object
is concentrated on for only one round, only
its alignment with respect to law and chaos
can be leamed. Certain magical devices ne-
gate the know alignment spell.
The reverse, undetectable alignment,
conceals the alignment of an object or crea-

ment spell.
l.eomund‘s Trap (illusion/Phantasm)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 3 rounds
Area of Effect; Object touched
Saving Throw: None
This false trap '5 designed to fool a thief or
other character attempting to pilfer the
spellcaster's goods. The wizard places the
spell upon any small mechanism or device,
such as a lock, hinge, hasp, screw-on cap,
ratchet, etc. Any character able to detect
traps, or who uses any spell or device ena-
bling trap detection, is 100% certain a real
trap exists. Of course, the spell is illusory
and nothing happens if the trap is sprung; its
primary purpose is to frighten away thieves
or make them waste precious time.
The material component of the spell is a
piece of iron pyrite touched to the object to
be trapped while the object is sprinkled with
a special dust requiring 200 gp to prepare. if
another Leomunds trap is within SO feet
when the spell is cast, then the casting fails.
levitate (Alteration)
Range: 20 yards/level
Components: V, 5, M
Duration: 1 turnl level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature or object
Saving Throw: Neg.
When a levitate spell is cast, the wizard
can place it upon his person, upon an ob-
ject, or upon a single creature, subject to a
maximum weight limit of 100 pounds per
level of experience (e.g.. a 3rd-level wizard
can levitate up to 300 pounds maximum). lf
the spell is cast upon the wizard, he can
move vertically up or down at a movement
rate of 2 per round. lf cast upon an object or
another creature, the wizard can levitate it
at the same speed according to his com-
mand. Horizontal movement is not empow-
ered by this spell, but the recipient could
push along the face of a cliff, for example, to
move laterally. The spellcaster can cancel
the spell as desired. If the subject of the spell
is unwilling, or the object is in the posses-
sion of a creature, a saving throw vs. spell is
allowed to detennine if the levitate spell af-
fects it.
Once cast, the spell requires no concen-
tration, except when changing height. A
levitating creature attempting to use a mis-
sile weapon finds himself increasingly un-
stable: the first attack has an attack roll
penalty of -1, the second -2, and the third
-3. etc., up to a maximum of -5. A full
round spent stabilizing allows the creature
I43
to begin again at - 1. Lack of leverage
makes it impossible to cock a medium or
heavy crossbow.
The material component of this spell is ei-
ther a small leather loop or a piece of golden
wire bent into a cup shape with a long shank
on one end.
Locate Object (Divination)
Reversible
Range: Z0 yards! level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 roundl level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell aids in locating a known or fa-
miliar object. The wizard casts the spell,
slowly tums, and senses when he is facing in
the direction of the object to be located, pro-
vided the object is within range, i.e., 60
yards for 3rd-level mages, BO yards for 4th,
100 yards for Sth, etc. The spell can locate
such objects as apparel, jewelry, furniture,
tools, weapons, or even a ladder or stair-
way. Note that attempting to find a specific
item such as jewelry or a crovm, requires an
accurate mental image; if the image is not
close enough to the actual, the spell does not
work. Desired but unique objects cannot be
located by this spell unless they are known
by the caster. The spell is blodced by lead.
Creatures cannot be found by this spell.
The material component is a forked twig.
The reversal, obscure object, hides an ob-
ject from location by spell, crystal ball, or
similar means for eight hours. Creatures
cannot be affected by this spell. The mate-
rial component is a chameleon skin.
Magic Mouth (Alteration)
Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 object
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, the wizard imbues
the chosen object with an enchanted mouth
that suddenly appears and speaks his mes-
sage when a specified event occurs. The
message, which must be of Z5 words or less,
can be in any language known by the spell-
caster, and can be delivered over a one-tum
period. The mouth cannot speak magical
spells or use command words. it does, how-
ever, move to the words articulated—if it is
placed upon a statue, the mouth of the
statue would actually move and appear to
speak. Of course, the magic mouth can be
placed upon a tree, rock, door, or any other
object, excluding intelligent members of the
animal or vegetable kingdoms.



The spell functions when specific condi-
tions are fulﬁlled, according to the com-
mand of the spellcaster. Some examples are
to speak “to the first creature that touches
you," or “to the first creature that passes
within 30 feet." Commands can be as general
or as detailed as desired, although only vis-
ual and audible triggers can be used, such as
the following: "Speak only when a venera-
ble female human carrying a sack of groat
clusters sits crosslegged within one foot ."
Such visual triggers can react to a character
using the disguise ability. Command range
is five yards per level of the wizard, so a 6th-
level wizard can command the magic mouth
to speak at a maximum encounter range of
30 yards ("Speak when a winged creature
comes within 30 yards."). The spell lasts un-
til the speak command can be fulfilled. thus
the spell duration is variable. A magic
mouth cannot distinguish invisible crea-
turs, alignments, level, Hit Dice, or class,
except by external garb. lf desired, the effect
can be keyed to a speciﬁc noise or spoken
word.
The material component of this spell is a
small bit of honeycomb.
Me|f’s Acid Arrow (Conjuration)
Range: 180 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 target
Saving Throw: Special
By means of this spell, the wizard creates
a magical arrow that speeds to its target as if
fired from the bow of a fighter of the same
level as the wizard. No modifiers for range,
non-proficiency, or specialization are used.
The arrow has no attack or damage bonus,
but it inﬂicts 2d4 points of acid damage
(with saving throws for items on the target).
(There is no splash damage.) For every three
levels that the caster has achieved, the acid
lasts for another round. unless somehow
neutralized, inﬂicting another Zd4 points of
damage each round. So at 3rd-5th level, the
acid lasts two rounds, at 6th-8th level, the
acid lasts for three rounds, etc.
The material components of the spell are
a dart, powdered rhubarb leaf, and an ad-
der's stomach.

Mirror Image (lllu.slo|\IPhantasm)
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 3 roundsl level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 6-foot radius
Saving Throw: None
When a mirror image spell is invoked, the
spellcaster causes from two to eight exact
duplicates of himself to come into being
around him. These images do exactly what
the wizard does. Since the spell causes a
blurring and slight distortion when it is cast,
it is impossible for opponents to be certain
which are the illusions and which is the ac-
tual wizard. When an image is struck by a
melee or missile attack, magical or other-
wise, it disappears, but any other existing
images remain intact until struck. The im-
ages seem to shift from round to round, so
that if the actual wizard is stnrck during one
round, he cannot be picked out from among
his images the next. To determine the num-
ber of images that appear. roll 1d4 and add 1
for every three levels of experience the wiz-
ard has achieved, to a maximum of eight im-
ages. At the end of the spell du.ration, all
surviving images wink out.
Mlsdlrectlon (Illusion/Phantum)
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: B hours
Casting Time: Z
Area of Effect: 1 creature or object
Saving Throw: Neg.
By means of this spell, the wizard misdi-
rects the information from a detection spell
(detect charm, detect evil, detect invisibil-
ity, detect lie, detect magic, detect snares
and pits, etc.). While the detection spell
functions, it indicates the wrong area, crea-
ture, or the opposite of the truth with re-
spect to detect evil or detect lie. The wizard
directs the spell effect upon the object of the
detection spell. if the caster of the detection
spell fails his saving throw vs. spell, the mis-
direction takes place. Note that this spell
does not affect other types of divination
(know alignment, 1114814"!/i ESE clairvoy-
ance, etc.).
Protection from Cantrips (Abiuration)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 5 hours + 1 hour/ level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Creature or object touched
Saving Throw: None
By casting this spell, the wizard receives
immunity to the effects of cantrips cast by
other wizards, apprentices, or creatures that
I44
use the cantrip spell. The spell protects the
caster, or one item or person that he touches
(such as a spell book or a drawer containing
spell components). Any cantrip cast against
the protected person or item dissipates with
an audible popping sound. This spell is of-
ten used by a wizard who has mischievous
apprentices, or one who wishes apprentices
to clean or shine an area using elbow grease
rather than magic. Any unwilling target of
this spell must be touched (via an attack
roll) and is allowed a saving throw vs. spell
to escape the effect.
Pyrotechnics (Alteration)
Range: 120 yards
Components: V. S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 fire source (special)
Saving Throw: None
A pyrotechnirs spell draws on an existing
fire source to produce either of two effects,
at the option of the caster. First, it can pro-
duce a ﬂashing and fiery burst of glowing,
colored aerial fireworks that lasts one
round. This effect temporarily blinds those
creatures in, under, or within 120 feet of the
area and that have an unobstnicted line of
sight to the burst. Creatures viewing this are
blinded for 1d4 + 1 rounds unless they suc-
cessfully save vs. spell. The fireworks fill a
volume ten times greater than that of the
original fire source.
This spell can also cause a thick, writhing
stream of smoke to arise from the source
and form a choking cloud that lasts for one
round per experience level of the caster. This
covers a roughly spherical volume from the
ground or floor up (or confomiing to the
shape of a confined area) that totally ob-
scures vision beyond two feet. The smoke
fills a volume 100 times that of the fire
source. All within the cloud must roll suc-
cessful saving throws vs. spell or stiffer -2
penalties to all combat rolls and Armor
Class.
The spell uses one fire source within a 20-
foot cube, which is immediately extin-
guished. An extremely large fire used as a
source might be only partially extinguished.
Magical fires are not extinguished, although
a fire-based creature (such as a fire elemen-
tal) used as a source suffers 1 point of dam-
age per caster level.



Ray of Enfeeblement
(Enchantment/Charm)
Range: 10 yards + 5 yards/level
Components: V. 5
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.
By means of a my of enfeeblement, a wiz-
ard weakens an opponent, reducing its
Strength and thereby the attacks that rely
upon it. Humans, demihulnans, and hu-
manoids of man-size or less are reduced to
an effective Strength of 5. losing all Strength
bonuses and suffering an attack roll penalty
of -2 and a -1 penalty to damage. Other
creatures suffer a penalty of -2 on attack
rolls. Furthermore. they have a
- 1 penalty for each die of damage they in-
flict. (But no damage roll can inﬂict less
than 1 point per die of damage.) Your DM
will determine any other effects appropriate
to the affected creature. If the target crea-
ture makes its saving throw, the spell has no
effect. This spell does not affect combat bo-
nuses due to magical items, and those con-
ferring increased Strength function
non-nally.
Rope Trick (Alteration)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 tumsl level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast upon a piece of
rope from five to 30 feet long, one end of the
rope rises into the air until the whole hangs
perpendicular, as if affixed at the upper end.
The upper end is, in fact, fastened to an ex-
tradimensional space. The spellcaster and
up to seven others can climb up the rope and
disappear into this place of safety where no
creature can find them. The rope can be
taken into the extradimensional space if
fewer than eight persons have climbed it,
otherwise it simply stays hanging in the air
(extremely strong creatures might be able to
remove it, at the DM's option). Spells can-
not be cast across the interdimensional in-
terface, nor can area effects cross it. Those
in the extradimensional space can see out of
it as if there is a 3' x 5' window centered on
the rope. The persons in the extradimen-
sional space must climb down prior to the
end of the spell, or they are dropped from
the height at which they entered the extradi-
mensional space. The rope can be climbed
by only one person at a time. Note that the
rope trick spell enables climbers to reach a
normal place if they do not climb all the way
to the extradimensional space. Also note
l |
Wizard Spells (Znd level) H
that creating or taking extradimensional
spaces into an existing extradimensional
space is hazardous.
The material components of this spell are
powdered corn extract and a twisted loop of
parchment.

than 6 Hit Dice or levels of experience to fall
into fits of trembling and shaking. The
frightened creatures have a -2 reaction ad-
justment and may drop items held if encum-
bered. lf cornered, they fight, but with - 1
penalties to attack and damage rolls, and to
saving throws as well.
Only elves, half-elves, and priests are al-
lowed saving throws against this spell. Note

bottles, ﬂasks. jugs. windows, mirrors, etc.
All such objects within a three-foot radius
of the center of the spell effect are smashed
into dozens of pieces by the spell. Objects
weighing more than one pound per level of
the caster are not affected. but all other ob-
jects of the appropriate composition must
save vs. crushing blow or be shattered. Al-
tematively, the spell can be focused against

Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 opponent
Saving Throw: None
This spell causes a ghostly, glowing hand,
shaped from the caster's life force, to materi-
alize within the spell range and move as the
caster desires. Any touch attack spell of 4th
level or less that is subsequently cast by the
wizard can be delivered by the spectral
hand. The spell gives the caster a +2 bonus
to his attack roll. The caster cannot perform
any other actions when attacking with the
hand; the hand retums to the caster and
hovers if the caster takes other actions. The
hand lasts the full spell duration unless dis-
missed by the caster. and it is possible to use
more than one touch attack with it. The
hand receives ﬂank and rear attack bonuses
if the caster is in a position to do so. The
hand is vulnerable to magical attack (but it
has an Armor Class of -Z). Any damage to
the hand ends the spell and inﬂicts 1d4
points of damage to the caster.
Stlnklng Cloud (Evocationl
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 roundl level
Casting Time:2
Area of Effect: 20-foot cube
Saving Throw: Special

up to 30 yards away from his position. Any
creature caught within the cloud must roll a
successful saving throw vs. poison or be
reeling and unable to attack because of nau-
sea, for 1d4 4' 1 rounds after leaving the
cloud. Those who make successful saving
throws can leave the cloud without suffer-
ing any ill effects, although those remaining
in the cloud must continue to save each
round. These poisonous effects can be
slowed or neutralized by appropriate
magic. The cloud duration is halved in a
moderate breeze (8-18 m.p.h) and is dis-
persed in one round by a stronger breeze.
The material component of the spell is a
rotten egg or several skunk cabbage leaves.

|‘ Wizard Spells (2nd
Strength (Alteration)
Range: Touch
Components: V. S, M
Duration: 1 hourl level
Casting Time: 1 tum
Area of Effect: Person touched
Saving Throw: None
Application of this spell increases the
Strength of the character by a number of
points—or tenths of points after 18 Strength
is attained (only if the character is a war-
rior). Benefits of the strength spell last for
the duration of the magic. The amount of
added Strength depends upon the spell re-
cipient's group and is subject to all restric-
tions on Strength due to race and class.
Multi-dass characters use the best die.
Class Strength Gain
Priest 1d6 points
Rogue 1d6 points
Warrior 1d8 points
Wizard 1d4 points
lf a warrior has an 16 Strength already,
from 10% to 80% is added to his extraordi-
nary Strength roll. The spell cannot confer a
Strength of 19 or more, nor is it cumulative
with other magic that adds to Strength. Be-
ings without Strength scores (kobolds, liz-
ard men, etc.) receive a +1 to attack and
damage rolls.
The material component of this spell is a
few hairs, or a pinch of dimg, from a partic-
ularly strong animal--ape, bear, ox, etc.
Su m mon Swarm
(Conluration/Summoning)
Range: 60 yards

Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 10-foot cube
Saving Throw: Neg.
The swarm of small animals (roll on fol-
lowing table to determine type, or the DM
can assipi an appropriate creature) drawn
by the summon swarm spell will viciously
attack all creatures in the area chosen by the
caster. Creatures actively defending against
the swarrn to the exclusion of other activi-
ties suffer 1 point of damage for each round
spent in the swarm. Those taking other
actions, including leaving the swarm, re-
ceive damage equal to 1d4 points + 1 point
per three levels of the caster, every round.
Note that spellcasting within the swarm is
impossible.
Dice Roll Swarm Type
O1-40 Rats
41 -70 Ba ts
71-B0 Spiders
81-90 Centipedes/beetles
91-100 Flying insects
Level)
The swarm cannot be fought effectively
with weapons, but fire and area effects can
force it to disperse by inﬂicting damage.
The swann disperses when it has taken a to-
tal of 2 hit points per caster level from these
attacks. A protection from evil spell keeps
the swarm at bay, and certain area-effect
spells, such as gust of wind and stinking
cloud, disperse a swarm immediately, if ap-
propriate to the swarm summoned (e.g.,
only ﬂyers are affected by a gust of wind).
The caster must remain stationary and un-
disturbed to control the swarm; if his con-
centration lapses or is broken, the swarm
disperses in two rounds. The swarm is sta-
tionary once conjured.
The material component is a square of red
cloth.
Tasha’s uncontrollable Hideous
laughter (Enchantment/Charm)
Range: 60 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round/ level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 or more creatures in a
30-foot cube
Saving Throw: Neg.
The victim of this spell perceives every-
thing as hilariously funny. The effect is not
immediate, and the creature feels only a
slight tingling on the round the spell is cast.
On the round immediately following, the
victim begins smiling, then giggling, chuck-
ling, tittering, snickering, guffawing, and fi-
nally collapsing into gales of
uncontrollable, hideous laughter. Although
this magical mirth lasts only a single round,
the affected creature must spend the next
round regaining its feet, and it loses 2 points
from its Strength (or - 2 to attack and dam-
age rolls) for all remaining rounds of the
spell.
The saving throw vs. spell is modified by
the intelligence of the creature. Creatures
with lntelligences of 4 or less (semi-
intelligent) are totally unaffected. Those
with lntelligences of 5-7 (low) save with - 6
penalties. Those with lntelligences of 8-12
(average to very) save with -4 penalties.
Those with lntelligences of 13-14 (high) save
with -2 penalties. Those with lntelligences
of 15 or greater (exceptional) have unmodi-
fied saving throws.
The caster can affect one creature for ev-
ery three levels attained—e.g., one at 3rd
level, two at bth level, three at 9th level, etc.
All affected beings must be within 30 feet of
each other.
The material components are a small
feather and minute tarts. The tarts are
hurled at the subjects, while the feather is
waved in one hand.

Web (Evocation)
Range: 5 yards/level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 tums/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Neg. or 1/z
A web spell creates a many-layered mass
of strong, sticky strands similar to spider
webs but far larger and tougher. These
masses must be anchored to two or more
solid and diametrically opposed points-
ﬂoor and ceiling, opposite walls, etc., or the
web collapses upon itself and disappears.
The web spell covers a maximum area of
eight 10' x 10' x 10' cubes and the webs must
be at least 10 feet thick, so a mass 40 feet
high, Z0 feet wide, and 10 feet deep may be
cast. Creatures caught within webs, or sim-
ply touching them, become stuck among the
gluey fibers.
Anyone in the area when the spell is cast
must roll a saving throw vs. spell with a -2
penalty. lf the saving throw is successful,
two things may have occurred. If the crea-
ture has room to escape the area, then it is
assumed to have jumped free. lf there is no
room to escape, then the webs are only half
strength. Creatures with less than 13
Strength (7 if the webs are half strength) are
stuck until freed by another or until the spell
wears off. Missile fire is generally ineffective
against creatures trapped in webs.
Creatures with Strengths between 13 and
17 can break through one foot of webs per
round. Creatures with 15 or greater
Strength can break through two feet of webs
per round. lf the webs are at half strength,
these rates are doubled. (Great mass equates
to great strength in this case, and creatures
of large mass hardly notice webs.) Strong
and huge creatures can break through 10
feet of webs per round.
Furthermore, the strands of a web spell
are ﬂammable. A magical flaming sword
can slash them away as easily as a hand
bnishes away cobwebs. Any fire—torch,
ﬂaming oil, ﬂaming sword, etc.—can set
them alight and bum them away in a single
round. All creatures within ﬂaming webs
suffer 2d4 points of damage from the
ﬂames, but those free of the strands are not
harmed.
The material component of this spell is a
bit of spider web.



Whispering Wind
(Alteration, Phantasm)
Range: 1 mile/level
Components: V. S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Z-foot radius
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the wizard is able
to either send a message or cause some de-
sired sound effect. The whispering wind can
travel as many miles above ground as the
spellcaster has levels of experience, to a spe-
cific location within range that is familiar to
the wizard. The whispering wind is as gentle
and unnoticed as a zephyr until it reaches
the location. lt then delivers its whisper-
quiet message or other sound. Note that the
message is delivered regardless of whether
anyone is present to hear it. The wind then
dissipates. The wizard can prepare the spell
to bear a message of up to 25 words, cause
the spell to deliver other sounds for one
round, or merely have the whispering wind
seem to be a faint stirring of the air that has
a susurrant sound, He can likewise cause the
whispering wind to move as slowly as a mile
per hour or as quickly as a mile every tum.
When the spell reaches its objective, it swirls
and remains until the message is delivered.
As with the magic mouth spell, no spells
may be cast via the whispering wind.
Wizard Lock (Alteration)
Range: Touch
Components; V, S
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 30 square feet/level
Saving Throw: None
A wizard lock spell cast upon a door,
chest. or portal magically locks it. The
caster can freely pass his own lock without
affecting it: otherwise, the wizard-locked
door or object can be opened only by break-
ing in, a successful dispel magic, or knock
spell, or by a wizard four or more levels
higher than the one casting the spell. Note
that the last two methods do not remove the
wizard lock. they only negate it for a brief
duration, about one turn. Creatures from
other planes cannot burst a wizard lock as
they can a held portal (see the hold portal
spell).
Third-Level Spells
Blink (Alteration)
Range: O
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the wizard causes
his material form to "blink" directly from
one point to another at a random time and
in a random direction. This means that me-
lee attacks against the wizard automatically
miss if initiative indicates they fall after he
has blinked.
Each round the spell is in effect, the wiz-
ard rolls 2d8 to determine the timing of the
blink—the result of the dice roll is used as
the wizards initiative for that round. The
wizard disappears and instantaneously re-
appears 10 feet distant from his previous po-
sition. (Direction is detemiined by roll of
1d8: 1 = right ahead, Z = right, 3 = right
behind, 4 = behind, 5 = left behind, 6 =
left, 7 = left ahead. 8 = ahead.)The caster
cannot blink into a solid object: if such is in-
dicated. reroll the direction. Movable ob-
jects of size and mass comparable to the
caster are shoved aside when the caster
blinks in. If blinking is impossible except
into a fixed, solid object, the caster is then
trapped on the Ethereal plane.
During each round that he blinks, the
spellcaster can be attacked only by oppo-
nents who win initiative or by those who are
able to strike both locations at once (e.g.,
with a breath weapon, fireball, or similar
wide-area attack forms). Opponents with
multiple attacks, or those operating under
haste or similar effects. can often strike
early enough to have at least one attack
against the caster.
I41
If the spellcaster holds off his attack (if
any) until after the blink, the 2d8 delay until
the blink is added to his normal 1d10 initia-
tive roll (thus he probably attacks last in the
round). Or the spellcaster can try to get his
attack in before he blinks (he must an-
nounce his intent before rolling the 2d8 for
blink timing and the 1d10 for initiative). in
this case, the caster compares the two dice
rolls, hoping that his initiative roll is lower
than his blink roll (the two rolls are not
added if he is trying to attack before he
blinks). If so, he attacks according to his ini-
tiative roll, then blinks according to the
blink roll. lf his blink roll is lower than his
initiative roll, however, he blinks out, then
he attacks in whatever direction he’s facing
(he must go through with his attack. even if
he is facing in the wrong direction to affect
anyone).
Clalraudlence (Divination)
Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
The clairnudience spell enables the wizard
to concentrate upon some locale and hear in
his mind any noise within a 60-foot radius
of the spell‘s casting point. Distance is not a
factor, but the locale must be known-a
place familiar to the spellcaster or an obvi-
ous one (such as behind a door, around a
comer. in a copse of trees, etc.). Only
sounds that are non-nally detectable by the
wizard can be heard by use of this spell.
Lead sheeting or magical protections pre-
vent the operation of the spell, and the wiz-
ard has some indication that the spell is so
blocked. Note that it functions only on the
wizard’s current plane of existence. The
spell creates an invisible sensor that can be
magically dispelled.
The material component of the spell is a
small horn of at least 100 gp value.
Clalrvoyance (Divination)
Range: Special
Components: V, 5, M
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
Similar to the clnimudience spell, the
clair-uoyance spell empowers the wizard to
see in his mind whatever is within sight
range from the spell locale chosen. Distance
from the wizard is not a factor, but the lo-
cale must be kt\own—familiar or obvious.
Furthennore, light is a factor, as the spell
does not enable the use of infravision or



magical enhancements. lf the area is magi-
cally dark, only darkness is seen; if natu-
rally pitch dark, only a 10-foot radius from
the center of the spell's area of effect can be
seen. Otherwise, the seeing extends to the
normal vision range according to the pre-
vailing light. Lead sheeting or magical pro-
tection foils a clairvoyance spell, and the
wizard has some indication that it is so
blocked. The spell creates an invisible sen-
sor, similar to that created by a crystal ball
spell, that can be dispelled. The spell func-
tions only on the wizard’s current plane of
existence.
The material component is a pinch of
powdered pineal gland.
Delllde (Alteration)
Range: O
Components: V, S
Duration: I tum/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: Neg.
By means of a delude spell, the wizard
conceals his own alignment with that of any
creature within a 30-foot radius at the time
the spell is cast. The creature must be of
higher than animal intelligence for the Spell
to work; its own alignment remains un-
changed. The creature receives a saving
throw vs. spell and, if successful, the delude
spell fails, lf the spell is successful, any
know alignment spell used against the caster
discovers only the assumed alignment. Note
that a detect good or detect evil also detects
the assumed aura, if the aura is strong
enough. The creature whose aura has been
assumed radiates magic, but the wizard ra-
diates magic only to the creature whose
alignment has been assumed. lf a delude
spell is used in conjunction with a change
self or alter self spell, the class of the wizard
can be totally hidden, if he is clever enough
to carry off the disguise.
Dispel Magic (Abiuration)
Range: 120 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 30-foot cube
Saving Throw: None
When a wizard casts this spell, it has a
chance to neutralize or negate magic it
Comes in contact with, as follows:
First. it removes spells and spell-like ef-
fects (including device effects and innate
abilities) from creatures or objects. Second.
it disrupts the casting or use of these in the
area of effect at the instant the dispel is cast.
Third, it destroys magical potions (which
are treated as 12th level for purposes of this
spell).
Each effect or potion in the spell's area is
checked to determine if it is dispelled. The
caster can always dispel his own magic; oth-
erwise the chance to dispel depends on the
difference in level between the magical ef-
fect and the caster. The base chance is 50%
(11 or higher on 1dZ0 to dispel). lf the caster
is higher level than the creator of the effect
to be dispelled, the difference is subtracted
from the number needed on 1d.2O to dispel
(thus making it more likely that the dispel
succeeds): if the caster is of lower level, then
the difference is added to the number
needed on 1dZ0 to dispel (making it less
likely that the dispel succeeds). A roll of 20
always succeeds and a roll of 1 always fails.
Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher, only a
roll of 1 prevents the effect from being dis-
peiled.
A dispel magic spell does not affect a spe-
cially enchanted item, such as a magical
scroll, ring, wand, rod, staff, miscellaneous
item, weapon, shield, or armor, unless it is
cast directly upon the item. This renders the
item nonoperational for 1d4 rounds. An
item possessed and carried by a creature
gains the creature's saving throw against
this effect, otherwise it is automatically ren~
dered nonoperational. An interdimensional
interface (such as a bag of holding) rendered
nonoperational would be temporarily
closed. Note that an item's physical proper-
ties are unchanged: a nonoperational magi-
cal sword is still a sword.
Artifacts and relics are not subject to this
spell; however, some of their spell-like ef-
fects may be, at the DM's option.
Note that this spell can be very effective
when used upon charmed and similarly be-
guiled creatures. Certain spells or effects
cannot be dispelled: these are listed in the
spell descriptions.
ells (3rd Level)
Explosive Runes (Attention)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 10-foot radius
Saving Throw: None or ‘/2
By tracing these mystic runes upon a
book, map, scroll, or similar object bearing
written information, the wizard prevents
unauthorized persons from reading his ma-
terial. The explosive runes are difficult to
detect-—S% chance per level of magic use
experience of the reader: thieves have only a
5% chance. But trap detection by spell or
magical device always finds these runes.
When read, the explosive runes detonate.
delivering 6d4 4' 6 points of damage to the
reader, who gets no saving throw. A like
amount, or half that if saving throws are
made, is suffered by each creature within
the blast radius. The wizard who cast the
spell, as well as any he instnicts, can read
the protected writing without triggering the
runes. Likewise, the wizard can remove the
runes whenever desired. Others can remove
them only with a successful dispel magic or
erase spell. Explosive runes otherwise last
until the spell is triggered. The item upon
which the runes are placed is destroyed
when the explosion takes place, unless it is
not normally subject to destruction by mag-
ical fire (see the ltem Saving Throws in the
Dungeon Masters Guide).

feign Death (Necromuicy)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 hour + 1 tum/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the caster (or any
other creature whose levels of experience or
Hit Dice do not exceed the wizard's own
level) can be put into a cataleptic state that is
impossible to distinguish from death.
Although the person or creature affected by
the feign death spell can smell, hear, and
know what is going on, no feeling or sight of
any sort is possible. Thus any wounding or
mistreatment of the body is not felt and no
reaction occurs; damage is only ‘/1 normal.
In addition, paralysis, poison, or energy-
level drain cannot affect an individual under
the inﬂuence of this spell. Poison injected or
otherwise introduced into the body takes
effect when the spell recipient is no longer
under the inﬂuence of this spell, although a
saving throw is permitted.
Note that only a willing individual can be
affected by feign death. The spellcaster can
end the spell effects at any time desired, as
will a successful dispel, but a full round is
required for bodily functions to begin again.
Fireball (Evocation)
Range: 10 yards + 10 yards/ level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: instantaneous
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Z0-foot radius
Saving Throw: 1/z
A fireball is an explosive burst of ﬂame,
which detonates with a low roar and deliv-
ers damage proportional to the level of the
wizard who cast it—1d6 points of damage
for each level of experience of the spellcaster
(up to a maximum of 1Od6). The burst of the
fireball creates little pressure and generally
conforms to the shape of the area in which it
occurs. The fireball fills an area equal to its
normal spherical volume (roughly 33,000
cubic feet—t.hirty-three 10' x 10' x 10’
cubes). Besides causing damage to crea-
tures, the fireball ignites all combustible
materials within its burst radius, and the
heat of the fireball melts soft metals such as
gold, copper, silver, etc. Exposed items
require saving throws vs. magical fire to
determine if they are affected, but items in
the possession of a ceature that rolls a suc-
cessful saving throw are unaffected by the
ﬁreball.
The wizard points his finger and speaks
the range (distance and height) at which the
ﬁreball is to burst. A streak ﬂashes from the
pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a
material body or solid barrier prior to
rl
Wizard Spells (3rd Level) fl
attaining the prescribed range, blossoms
into the fireball (an early impact results in
an early detonation). Creatures failing their
saving throws each suffer full damage from
the blast. Those who roll successful saving
throws manage to dodge, fall ﬂat, or roll
aside, each reoeiving half damage (the DM
rolls the damage and each affected creature
suffers either full damage or half damage
[round fractions down], depending on
whether the creature saved or not).
The material component of this spell is a
tiny ball of bat guano and sulphur.
Flame Arrow (Coniurltion/Summoning)
Range: 30 yards + 10 yards/level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell has two effects. First, the wiz-
ard can cause normal arrows or crossbow
bolts to become magical ﬂaming missiles for
one round. The missiles must be nocked and
drawn (or cocked) at the completion of the
spell. If they are not loosed within one
round, they are consumed by the magic. For
every five levels the caster has achieved, up
to 10 arrows or bolts can be affected. The
arrows inﬂict normal damage, plus 1 point
of fire damage to any target struck. They
may also cause incendiary damage. This
version of the spell is used most often in
large battles.
The second version of this spell enables
the caster to hurl fiery bolts at opponents
within range. Each bolt inﬂicts 1d6 points of
piercing damage, plus 4d6 points of fire
damage. Only half of the fire damage is
inﬂicted if the creature struck saves vs.
spell. The caster receives one bolt for every
five experience levels (two bolts at 10th
level, three at 15th level, etc.). Bolts must be
used on creatures within 20 yards of each
other and in front of the wizard.
The material components for this spell are
a drop of oil and a small piece of flint.
Fly (Alteration)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 tum/level + 1d6 turns
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the wizard to bestow
the power of magical ﬂight. The creature
affected is able to move vertically and hor-
izontally at a rate of 18 (half that if ascend-
ing, twice that if descending in a dive). The
maneuverability class of the Ueature is B.
Using the fly Spell requires as much concen-
tration as walking, so most spells can be cast
I49
while hovering or moving slowly (move-
ment of 3). Possible combat penalties while
ﬂying are known to the DM (in the "Aerial
Combat" section of the DMG). The exact
duration of the spell is always unknown to
the spellcaster, as the variable addition is
determined secretly by the DM.
The material component of the ﬂy spell is
a wing feather of any bird.
Gust of Wind (Alteration)
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect; 10-foot wide path, 10
yardsl level long
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, a strong puff of air
originates from the wizard and moves in the
direction he is facing. The force of this gust
of wind (about 30 m.p.h) is sufficient to
extinguish candles, torches, and similar
unprotected flames. lt causes protected
ﬂames—such as those of lanterns—to dance
wildly and has a 5% chance per level of
experience of the spellcaster to extinguish
even such lights. It also fans large fires out-
ward 1d6 feet in the direction of the wind's
movement. lt forces back small ﬂying crea-
tures 1d6 X 10 yards and causes man-sized
beings to be held motionless if attempting to
move against its force. lt slows larger-than-
man-sized ﬂying creatures by 50% for one
round. lt blows over light objects, disperses
most vapors. and forces away gaseous or
unsecured levitating creatures. Its path is 10
feet wide by 10 yards long per level of expe-
rience of the caster (e.g. , an 8th-level wizard
causes a gust of wind that travels BO yards).
The material component of the spell is a
legume seed.
Haste (Alteration)
Range: 60 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 40' cube, 1 creature/level
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, each affected crea-
ture functions at double its normal move-
ment and attack rates. A hasted creature
gains a -2 initiative bonus. Thus, a crea-
ture moving at 6 and attacking once per
round would move at 12 and attack twice
per round. Spellcasting and spell effects are
not sped up. The number of creatures that
can be affected is equal to the caster's experi-
ence level; those creatures closest to the cen-
ter of effect are affected first. All affected by
haste must be in the designated area of
effect. Note that this spell negates the effects
of a slow spell. Additionally, this spell ages



the recipient by one year, because of sped-
up metabolic processes. This spell is not cu-
mulative with itself or with other similar
magic.
lts material component is a shaving of lic-
orice root.
Hold Person (Enchantment/Charm)
Range: 120 yards
Components: V. 5, M
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 to 4 persons in a
20-foot cube
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell holds 1d4 humans, demihu-
mans. or humanoid creatures rigidly immo-
bile for five or more rounds.
The hold person spell affects any bipedal
human, demihuman or humanoid of man-
size or smaller, including brownies, dryads.
dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins,
half-elves. halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins,
humans, kobolds, lizard men. nixies, orcs,
pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others.
The spell is centered on a point selected
by the caster; it affects persons selected by
the caster within the area of effect. If the
spell is cast at three or four people, each gets
an unmodified saving throw. If only two
people are being enspelled, each makes his
saving throw with a -1 penalty. if the spell
is cast at only one person, the saving throw
suffers a -3 penalty. Saving throws are ad-
iusted for Wisdom. Those succeeding on
their saving throws are unaffected by the
spell. Undead creatures cannot be held.
Held beings cannot move or speak, but
they remain aware of events around them
and can use abilities not requiring motion or
speech. Being held does not prevent the
worsening of the subjects’ condition due to
wounds, disease, or poison. The caster can
end the spell with a single utterance at any
time; otherwise the duration is 10 rounds at
5th level, 12 rounds at 6th level, 14 rounds
at 7th level, etc.
The spellcaster needs a small, straight
piece of iron as the material component of
this spell.
Hold Undead (Necromancy)
Range: 60'
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1d4 rounds +1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1d3 undead
Saving Throw: Neg.
When cast, this spell renders immobile
1d3 undead creatures whose total Hit Dice
are equal to or less than the casters level. No
more than three undead can be affected by a
single spell. To cast, the wizard aims the
spell at a point within range and the three
undead closest to this are considered to be in
the area of effect, provided all are within the
field of vision and spell range of the caster.
Undead of a mindless nature (skeletons,
zombies, or ghouls) are automatically af-
fected. Other forms of undead are allowed a
saving throw to negate the effect. If the spell
is successful, it renders the undead immobile
for the duration of the spell.
The material component for this spell is a
pinch of sulphur and powdered garlic.
llluslonary Script (Illusion/Phantasm)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 day/level
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: Creature reading the script
Saving Throw: Special
This spell enables the wizard to write in-
structions or other information on parch-
ment, paper, etc. The illusionary script
appears to be some form of foreign or maﬁ-
cal writing. Only the person (or people)
who the wizard desires to read the writing
can do so. An illusionist recognizes it for il-
lusionary script.
Unauthorized creatures glancing at the
script must roll saving throws vs. spell. A
successful save means the creature can look
away with only a mild sense of disorienta-
tion. Failure means the creature is subject to
a suggestion implanted in the script by the
caster at the time the illusionary script was
cast. The suggestion cannot require more
than three turns to carry out. The sugges-
tion could be to close the book and leave, or
to forget the existence of the book, for ex-
ample. A successful dispel magic spell will
remove the illusionary script, but an unsuc-
cessful attempt erases all of the writing. The
hidden writings can be read by a combina-
tion of the true seeing spell and either the
read magic or comprehend languages spell,
as applicable.
The material component is a lead-based
ink that requires special manufacture by an
alchemist, at a cost of not less than 300 gp
per usage.
lnfravlslon (Alteration)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 hours + 1 hour/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the wizard enables
the recipient to see in normal darkness up to
60 feet without light. Note that strong
sources of light (fire, lantems, torches, etc.)
tend to blind this vision, so infravision does
not function efficiently in the presence of
such light sources. invisible creatures are
I50
not detectable by infravision.
The material component of this spell is ei-
ther a pinch of dried carrot or an agate.
lnvlslblllty, I 0' Radius
(llluslon/Phantasmj
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 10-foot radius of
creature touched
Saving Throw: None
This spell confers invisibility upon all
creatures within 10 feet of the recipient.
Gear carried and light sources are included,
but any light emitted is still visible. The cen-
ter of the effect is mobile with the recipient.
Those affected by this spell cannot see each
other. Any affected creature moving out of
the area becomes visible, but creatures mov-
ing into the area after the spell is cast do not
become invisible. Affected creatures (other
than the recipient) that attack negate the in-
visibility only for themselves. lf the spell re-
cipient attacks, the invisibility, 10' radius
spell is broken for all.
The material components are the same as
for the invisibility spell.
Item (Alteration)
Range: Touch
Components: V. S, M
Duration: 4 hours/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 2 cu. ft./ level
Saving Throw: Special
By means of this spell, the wizard is able
to shrink one nonmagical item (if it is within
the size limit) to Viz of its non-nal size. Op-
tionally, the caster can also change its now-
shmnken composition to a cloth-like one.
An object in the possession of another crea-
ture is allowed a saving throw vs. spell. Ob-
iects changed by an item spell can be
returned to normal composition and size
merely by tossing them onto any solid sur-
face or by a word of command from the
original spellcaster. Note that even a bum-
ing fire and its fuel can be shrunk by this
spell.

l.eomund's ‘I'lny Hut (Alteration)
Range; O
Components: V, S. M
Duration: 4 hours + 1 hour/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 15-foot-diameter sphere
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast. the wizard creates
an unmoving, opaque sphere of force of any
desired color around his person. Half of the
sphere proiects above the ground, and the
lower hemisphere passes through the
ground. Up to seven other man-sized crea-
tures can fit into the field with its creator,
and these can freely pass into and out of the
hut without harming it, but if the spellcaster
removes himself from it. the spell dissipates.
The temperature inside the hut is 70“ F, if
the exterior temperature is between 0° and
100“ F. An exterior temperature below 0° or
above 100° lowers or raises, respectively,
the interior temperature on a 1°-for-1“
basis. The tiny hut also provides protection
against the elements, such as rain, dust,
sandstorms, and the like. The hut can with-
stand any wind of less than hurricane force
without being harmed, but wind force
greater than that destroys it.
The interior of the hut is a hemisphere;
the spellcaster can illuminate it dimly upon
command, or extinguish the light as desired.
Note that although the force field is opaque
from the outside, it is transparent from
within. Missiles. weapons, and most spell
effects can pass through the hut without
affecting it, although the occupants cannot
be seen from outside the hut. The hut can be
dispelled.
The material component for this spell is a
small orystal bead that shatters when the
spell duration expires or the hut is dispelled.
llghtnlng Bolt (Evoca tion)
Range: 40 yards + 10 yards/ level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: instantaneous
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/;
Upon casting this spell, the wizard
releases a powerful stroke of electrical
energy that inflicts 1cl6 points of damage per
level of the spellcaster (maximum damage of
10d6) to each creature within its area of
effect. A successful saving throw vs. spell
reduces this damage to half (round fractions
down). The bolt begins at a range and
height decided by the caster and streala out-
ward in a direct line from the casting wizard
(e.g., if a 40-foot bolt was started at 180 feet
from the wizard, the far end of bolt would
reach 220 feet (180 + 40). The lightning bolt
may set fire to combustibles, sunder wood-
en doors, splinter up to ‘/2 foot thickness of
Wizard Spells (3rd Level) l
stone, and melt metals with a low melting
point (lead, gold, copper, silver, bronze).
Saving throws must be rolled for objects
that withstand the full force of a stroke (see
the ﬁreball spell). if the damage caused to an
interposing barrier shatters or breaks
through it (i.e., the saving throw fails), the
bolt continues. A bolt can breach one inch
of wood or 1/2 inch of stone per caster level
up to a maximum of one foot of wood or ‘/2
foot of stone.
The lightning bolt's area of effect is cho-
sen by the spellcaster: either a forked bolt
10 feet wide and 40 feet long or a single bolt
five feet wide and 80 feet long. lf a bolt can-
not reach its full length, because of an
unyielding barrier (such as a stone wall), the
lightning bolt rebounds from the ban'ier
toward its caster. ending only when it reach-
es its full length.
Example: An 80-foot-long stroke is
begun at a range of 40 feet, but it hits a stone
wall at 50 feet. The bolt travels 10 feet. hits
the wall, and rebounds for 70 feet back
toward its creator (who is only SO feet from
the wall, and so is caught in his own light-
ning boltl).
The DM might allow reﬂecting bolts.
When this type of lightning bolt strikes a
solid surface, the bolt reﬂects from the sur-
face at an angle equal to the angle of inci-
dence (like light off a mirror). A creature
crossed more than once by the bolt must roll
a saving throw for every time it is crossed.
but it still suffers either full damage (if one
saving throw is missed) or half damage (if
all saving throws are made).
The material components of the spell are
a bit of fur and an amber, uystal, or glass
rod.
MeIf’s Mlnute Meteors
(Evocation, Alteration)
Range: 70 yards + 10 yards/level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 target per meteor
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the wizard to cast small
globes of fire (one for each experience level
he has attained), each of which bursts into a
one-foot-diameter sphere upon impact,
inﬂicting 1d4 points of damage to the crea-
ture stmck. lt can also ignite combustible
materials (even solid planks). The meteors
are treated as missiles hurled by the wizard
with a +2 bonus to the attack rolls and with
no penalty for range. Misses are treated as
grenadelike missiles that inﬂict 1 point of
damage to creatures within three feet.
The spell can be cast in either of two
ways:
A) The wizard discharges five meteors
every round (see the “Multiple Attacks and
I51
lnitiative" section, page 95). Note that this
carries over into at least the following
round.
B) The wizard discharges only one meteor
per round. ln addition to releasing the mis-
sile, the caster can perform other actions in
the round, including speﬂcasting, melee, or
device use. Spells requiring concentration
force the wizard to forgo the rest of the mis-
siles to maintain concentration. Also, if the
wizard fails to maintain an exact mental
count of the number of missiles he has
remaining, he has involuntarily lost the
remaining portion of the spell.
The spell ends when the caster has fired
off as many meteors as he has experience
levels, when he forgoes casting any still
remaining, or when a successful dispel mag-
ic spell is thrown upon the caster.
The components necessary for the casting
of this spell are nitre and sulphur formed
into a bead by the addition of pine tar. The
caster must also have a small hollow tube of
minute proportion, fashioned from gold.
The tube costs no less than 1,000 gp to con-
struct, so fine is its workmanship and magi-
cal engraving, and it can be reused.

summoned monsters can, if the wizard can
communicate with them and if they are
physically able, perform other services for
the summoning wizard.
In rare cases, adventurers have been
known to disappear, summoned by power-
ful spellcasters using this spell. Those surn-
moned recall all the details of their trip.

creature or object touched undetectable by
divination spells such as clairaudience.
clairooyance, locate object, ESP, and detect
spells. it also prevents location by such
magical items as crystal balk and ESP me-
dallions. lt does not affect the know align-
ment spell or the ability of intelligent or

P |lil'l10lTl 5¢9¢d (Con]uratlon, Phantasml
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 hour/level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, the wizard creates
a quasi-real, horse-like creature. The steed
can be ridden only by the wizard who cre-
ated it. or by any person for whom the wiz-
ard specifically creates such a mount. A
phantom steed has a black head and body,
gray mane and tail, and smoke-colored, in-
substantial hooves that make no sound. lts
eyes are milky-colored. lt does not fight,
but all normal animals shun it and only
monstrous ones will attack. The mount has
an Armor Class of 2 and 7 hit points, plus 1
per level of the caster. if it loses all of its hit
points, the phantom steed disappears, A
phantom steed moves at a movement rate of
4 per level of the spellcaster, to a maximum
movement rate of 48. lt has what seems to
be a saddle and a bit and bridle. lt can bear
its rider's weight, plus up to 10 pounds per
caster level.
These mounts gain certain powers ac-
cording to the level of the wizard who cre-
ated them:
8th Level: The ability to pass over sandy.
muddy, or even swampy ground without
difficulty.
10th Level: The ability to pass over water
as if it were fixrn, dry ground.
12th Level: The ability to travel in the air
as if it were finn land, so chasms and the like
can be crossed without benefit of a bridge.
Note. however, that the mount cannot casu-
ally take off and fly: the movement must be
between points of similar altitude.
14th Level: The ability to perform as if it
were a pegasus; it ﬂies at a rate of 48 per
round upon command.
Note that a mount's abilities include those
of lower levels: thus a 12th-level mount has
the 8th-, 10th-. and 12th-level abilities.
Protection from Evll, IO’ Radius
(Maturation)
Reversible
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Z rounds/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 10-foot-radius sphere
around creature touched
Saving Throw: None
The globe of protection of this spell is
identical in all respects to a protection from
evil spell, except that it encompasses a much
larger area and its duration is greater. The
effect is centered on and moves with the
creature touched. Any protected creature
within the circle can break the warding
against enchanted or summoned monsters
by meleeing them. If a creature too large to
fit into the area of effect is the recipient of
the spell, the spell acts as a normal protec-
tion from evil spell for that creature only.
To complete this spell, the caster must
trace a circle 20 feet in diameter using pow-
dered silver. The material component for
the reverse is powdered iron.
Protection from Normal Mlsslles
(Abjurationl
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 tum/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the wizard bestows
total invulnerability to hurled and projected
missiles such as arrows, axes. bolts, iave-
lins, small stones, and spears. Furthermore,
it causes a reduction of 1 from each die of
damage (but no die inﬂicts less than 1 point
of damage) inﬂicted by large or magical
missiles, such as ballista missiles, catapult
stones, hurled boulders, and magical ar-
rows, bolts, iavelins, etc. Note. however,
that this spell does not convey any protec-
tion from such magical attacks as fireballs,
lightning bolts, or magic missiles.
The material component of this spell is a
piece of tortoise or turtle shell.

Secret Page (Alteration)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Until dispelled
Casting Time: I turn
Area of Effect: 1 page of any size,
up to 2 ft. square
Saving Throw: None
When cast, a secret page spell alters the
actual contents of a page so that they appear
to be something entirely different. Thus a
map can be changed to become a treatise on
bumishing ebony walking sticks. The text
of a spell can be altered to show a ledger
page or even another form of spell. Confuse
languages and explosive runes spells may be
cast upon the secret page, but a comprehend
languages spell cannot reveal the secret
page's contents. The caster is able to reveal
the original contents by speaking a com-
mand word, perusing the actual page, and
then retuming it to its secret page form. The
caster can also remove the spell by double
repetition of the command word. Others
noting the dim magic of a page with this
spell doaking its true contents can attempt
to dispel magic, but if it fails, the page is de-
stroyed. A true seeing spell does not reveal
the contents unless cast in combination with
a comprehend languages spell. An erase
spell can destroy the writing.
The material components are powdered
herring scales and either will o’ wisp or bog-
gart essence.
Sepla Snake Slgll
(Coniuration/Summoning)
Range: 5 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 sigil
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, a small written
symbol appears in the text of any written
work. When read, the so-called sepia snake
springs into being and strikes at the nearest
living creature (but does not attack the wiz-
ard who cast the spell). lts attack is made as
if it were a monster with Hit Dice equal to
the level of the wizard who cast the spell. If
it strikes successfully, the victim is engulfed
in a shimmering amber field of force, frozen
and immobilized u.ntil released, either at the
caster's command, by a successful dispel
magic spell. or until a time equal to Id-1 days
+ 1 clay per caster level has elapsed. Until
then, nothing can get at the victim, move
the shimmering force surrounding him, or
otherwise affect him. The victim does not
age, grow hungry, sleep, or regain spells
while in this state. He is not aware of his sur-
roundings.



If the sepia snake misses its target, it dissi-
pates in a flash of brown light, with a loud
noise and a puff of dun-colored smoke that
is 10 feet in diameter and lasts for one
round.
The spell cannot be detected by normal
observation. and detect magic reveals only
that the entire text is magical. A dispel mag-
ic can remove it; an erase spell destroys the
entire page of text. It can be cast in combina-
tion with other spells that hide or garble
t¢Xl.
The components for the spell are 100 gp
worth of powdered amber, a scale from any
snake, and a pinch of mushroom spores.
Slow (Alteration)
Range: 90 yards + 10 yards/level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 40' cube, 1 creature/level
Saving Throw: Neg,
A slow spell causes affected creatures to
move and attack at ‘/2 of their normal rates.
lt negates a haste spell or equivalent, but
does not otherwise affect magically speeded
or slowed creatures. Slowed creatures have
an Armor Class penalty of +4 AC, an
attack penalty of -4, and all Dexterity
combat bonuses are negated. The magic
affects a number of creatures equal to the
spellcaster's level, if they are within the area
of effect chosen by the wizard (i.e., a 40-
foot cubic volume centered as called for by
the caster). The creatures are affected from
the center of the spell outward. Saving
throws against the spell suffer a - 4 penalty.
The material component of this spell is a
drop of molasses.
Spectral force (llluslonlPhantasm)
Range: 60 yards + 1 yard/level
Components: V. S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 40' cube + a 10' cube/level
Saving Throw: Special

in which sound, smell, and thermal illusions
are included. lt is otherwise similar to the
improved phantasmnl force spell. The spell
last for three rounds after concentration
ceases.
Wizard Spells (3rd Level)
Sllggcstlcll (Ellchantment/Charm)
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, M
Duration: 1 hour + 1 hour/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw; Neg.
When this spell is cast by the wizard, he
inﬂuences the actions of the chosen recipient
by the utterance of a few words—phrases or
a sentence or two—suggesting a course of
action desirable to the spellcaster. The crea-
ture to be inﬂuenced must, of course, be
able to understand the wizard's sug-
gestion—it must be spoken in a language
that the spell recipient understands.
The suggestion must be worded in such a
manner as to make the action sound reason-
able: asking the creature to stab itself.
throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or
do some other obviously harmful act auto-
matically negates the effect of the spell.
However, a suggestion that a pool of acid
was actually pure water and that a quick dip
would be refreshing is another matter. Urg-
ing a red dragon to stop attacking the wiz-
ard's party so that the dragon and party
could jointly loot a rich treasure elsewhere
is likewise a reasonable use of the spell's
power.
The course of action of a suggestion can
continue in effect for a considerable dura-
tion, such as in the case of the red dragon
mentioned above. Conditions that will trig-
ger a special action can also be specified; if
the condition is not met before the spell
expires, then the action will not be per-
formed. lf the target successfully rolls its
saving throw, the spell has no effect. Note
that a very reasonable suggestion causes the
saving throw to be made with a penalty
(such as -1, -Z, etc.) at the discretion of
the Dungeon Master. Undead are not sub-
iect to suggestion.
The material components of this spell are
a snake's tongue and either a bit of honey-
comb or a drop of sweet oil.
Tongues (Alteration)
Reversible

Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 30-foot radius
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the wizard to speak and
understand additional languages, whether
they are racial tongues or regional dialects.
This does not enable the caster to speak with
animals. The spell enables the caster to be
understood by all creatures of that type
within hearing distance, usually 60 feet.
I53
This spell does not predispose the subject
toward the caster in any way.
The wizard can speak one additional
tongue for every three levels of experience.
The reverse of the spell cancels the effect of
the tongues spell or confuses verbal com-
munication of any sort within the area of
effect.
The material component is a small clay
model of a ziggurat, which shatters when
the spell is pronounced.
Vamplrlc Touch (Necrornancy)
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: One touch
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
When the caster touches an opponent in
melee with a successful attack roll, the
opponent loses 1d6 hit points for every two
caster levels, to a maximum drain of bdé for
a 12th-level caster. The spell is expended
when a successful touch is made or one turn
passes. The hit points are added to the cast-
er‘s total, with any hit points over the cast-
er‘s normal total treated as temporary
additional hit points. Any damage to the
caster is subtracted from the temporary hit
points first. After one hour, any extra hit
points above the casters nonnal total are
lost. The creature originally losing hit
points through this spell can regain them by
magical or normal healing. Undead crea-
tures are unaffected by this spell.
Water Breathing (Alteration)
Reversible
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 hour/level + 1d4 hours
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
The recipient of a water breathing spell is
able to breathe water freely for the duration
of the spell. The caster can touch more than
one creature with a single casting; in this
case the duration is divided by the number
of creatures touched. The reverse, air
breathing, enables water-breathing crea-
tures to comfortably survive in the atmos-
phere for an equal duration.
The material component of the spell is a
short reed or piece of straw.



Hi. Wizard Spells (4th Level)
Wlnd Wall (Alteration)
Range: 10 yards/ level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: A 10' wide X 5' high area
per caster level
Saving Throw: Special
This spell brings forth an invisible vertical
curtain of wind two feet thick and of consid-
erable strength-a strong breeze sufficient
to blow away any bird smaller than an eagle
or to tear papers ar\d like materials from
unsuspecting hands. (lf in doubt, a saving
throw vs. spell detemiines whether the sub-
ject maintains its grasp.) Normal insects
cannot pass such a barrier. Loose materials,
even cloth garments, fly upward when
caught in a wind wall. Arrows and bolts are
deﬂected upward and miss, while sling
stones and other missiles under two pounds
in weight receive a -4 penalty to a first shot
and -2 penalties thereafter. Gases, most
breath weapons. and creatures in gaseous
form cannot pass this wall, although it is no
barrier to noncorporeal creatures.
The material components are a tiny fan
and a feather of exotic origin.
Wralthforln (Alteration, Illusion)
Range: 0
Components: S, M
Duration: 2 roundsl level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, the wizard and all
of his gear become insubstantial. The caster
is subject only to magical or special attacks,
including those by weapons of + 1 or better,
or by creatures otherwise able to affect
those struck only by magical weapons.
Undead of most sorts will ignore an individ-
ual in wraithform, believing him to be a
wraith or spectre, though a lich or special
undead may save vs. spell with a -4 penal-
ty to recognize the spell.
The wizard can pass through small holes
or narrow openings, even mere cracks. with
all he wears or holds in his hands, as long as
the spell persists. Note, however, that the
the caster cannot fly without additional
magic. No form of attack is possible when in
wraithform, except against creatures that
exist on the Ethereal plane, where all attacks
(both ways) are normal. A successful dispel
magic spell forces the wizard in wraithform
back to normal forrn. The spellcaster can
end the spell with a single word.
The material components for the spell are
a bit of gauze and a wisp of smoke.
more Hit Dice or levels, regardless of the
number rolled.
All possible subjects receive saving
throws vs. spell, adjusted for Wisdom. Any
damage inﬂicted by the caster or his allies in
the round of casting grants the wounded
creature another saving throw at a bonus of
+ 1 per point of damage received. Any
affected creature regards the spellcaster as
friendly, an ally or companion to be treated
well or guarded from harm. lf communica-
tion is possible, the charmed creature fol-
lows reasonable requests, instnictions, or
orders most faithfully (see the suggestion
spell). If communication is not possible, the
creature does not harm the caster, but others
in the vidnity may be subject to its inten-
tions, hostile or otherwise. Any overtly hos-
tile act by the caster breaks the spell, or at
the very least allows a new saving throw
against the charm. Affected creatures even-
tually come out from under the inﬂuence of
the spell. This is a function of the creature's
level (i.e., its Hit Dice).

Confusion (Enchantment/Charm)
Range: 110 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Up to 60-foot cube
Saving Throw: Special
This spell causes confusion in one or more
creatures within the area, creating indeci-
sion and the inability to take effective
action. The spell affects 1d-1 creatures, plus
one aeature per caster level. These nea-
tures are allowed saving throws vs. spell
with -2 penalties, adjusted for Wisdom.
Those successfully saving are unaffected by
the spell. Confused creatures react as fol-
lows (roll 1d10):
1 Wander away (unless prevented)
for duration of spell
2-6 Stand confused one round
(then roll again)
7-9 Attack nearest creature for one round
(then roll again)
10 Act normally for one round
(then roll again)



The spell lasts for two rounds plus one
round for each level of the caster. Those
who fail are checked by the DM for actions
each round for the duration of the spell, or
until the "wander away for the duration of
the spell" result occurs.
Wandering creatures move as far from the
caster as possible, according to their most
typical mode of movement (characters
walk, fish swim, bats fly, etc.). Saving
throws and actions are checked at the begin-
ning of each round. Any confused creature
that is attacked perceives the attacker as an
enemy and acts according to its basic
nature.
lf there are many creatures involved, the
DM may decide to assume average results.
For example, if there are 16 orcs affected
and 25% could be expected to make the sav-
ing throw, then four are assumed to have
succeeded. Out of the other 12, one wanders
away, four attack the nearest creature, six
stand confused, and the last acts normally
but must check next round. Since the orcs
are not near the party, the DM decides that
two attacking the nearest creature attack
each other, one attacks an orc that saved,
and one attacks a confused orc, which
strikes back. The next round, the base is 11
orts, since four originally saved and one
wandered off. Another one wanders off,
five stand confused, four attack, and one
acts normally.
The material component is a set of three
nut shells.
Contagion (Necromancy)
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: Pennanent
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell causes a major disease and
weakness in a creature. The afflicted indi-
vidual is immediately stricken with painful
and distracting symptoms: boils, blotches,
lesions, seeping abscesses. and so on.
Strength, Dexterity, and Charisma are
reduced by 2. Attack rolls are decreased by
2. The effect persists until the character
receives a cure disease spell or spends 1d3
weeks taking a complete rest to recover.
Characters ignoring the contagion for more
than a day or so may be susceptible to worse
diseases at the discretion of the DM.
Wizard Spells (4th Level)
Detect Scrylng (Divimuonl
Range: O
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1d6 turns + 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 120-foot radius
Saving Throw: Special
By means of this spell, the wizard imme-
diately becomes aware of any attempt to
observe him by means of clairvoyance,
clairaudience, or magic mirror. This also
reveals the use of crystal balls or other magi-
cal scrying devices, provided the attempt is
within the area of effect of the spell. Since
the spell is centered on the spellcaster, it
moves with him, enabling him to “sweep”
areas for the duration of the spell.
When a scrying attempt is detected, the
scryer must immediately roll a saving
throw. lf this is failed, the identity and gen-
eral location of the scryer immediately
become known to the wizard who cast this
spell. The general location is a direction and
significant landmark close to the scryer.
Thus, the caster might lea.rn, "The wizard
Sniggel spies on us from east, under the
stairs," or, “You are watched by Asquil in the
city of Sarnarquol."
The material components for this spell are
a small piece of mirror and a miniature brass
hearing trumpet.
Dlg (Evocation)
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 roundl level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 5-foot cubel level
Saving Throw: Special
A dig spell enables the caster to excavate
125 cubic feet of earth, sand, or mud per
round (i.e., a cubic hole five feet on a side).
In later rounds the caster can expand an
existing hole or start a new one. The materi-
al thrown from the excavation scatters
evenly around the pit. lf the wizard con-
tinues downward past 20 feet in earth, there
is a 15% chance that the pit collapses. This
check is made for every five feet dug beyond
20 feet. Sand tends to collapse after 10 feet,
mud fills in and collapses after five feet, and
quicksand fills in as rapidly as it is dug.
Any creature at the edge (within one foot)
of a pit must roll a successful Dexterity
check or fall into the hole. Creatures mov-
ing rapidly toward a pit dug immediately
before them must roll a saving throw vs.
spell to avoid falling in. Any creature in a
pit being excavated can climb out at a rate
decided by the DM. A creature caught in a
collapsing pit must roll a saving throw vs.
death to avoid being buried; it escapes the
pit if successful. Tunneling is possible with
this spell as long as there is space available
I55
for the material removed. Chances for col-
lapse are doubled and safe tunneling dis-
tance is half of the safe excavation depth
unless such construction is most carefully
braced and supported.
The spell is also effective against creatures
of earth and rock, particularly clay golems
and those from the elemental plane of Farth.
When cast upon such a creature, it suffers
4d6 points of damage. A successful saving
throw vs. spell reduces this damage to half.
To activate the spell, the spellcaster needs
a miniature shovel and tiny bucket and
must continue to hold them while each pit is
excavated, These items disappear at the
conclusion of the spell.
Dllnenslon Door (Alteration)
Range: 0
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
By means of a dimension door spell, the
wizard instantly transfers himself up to 30
yards distance per level of experience. This
special form of teleportation allows for no
error, and the wizard always arrives at
exactly the spot desired—whether by sim-
ply visualizing the area (within spell transfer
distance, of course) or by stating direction
such as, "300 yards straight downward." or,
"upward to the northwest, 45 degree angle,
420 yards." lf the wizard arrives in a place
that is already occupied by a solid body, he
remains trapped in the Astral plane. lf dis-
tances are stated and the spellcaster arrives
with no support below his feet (i.e., in mid-
air). falling and damage result unless further
magical means are employed. All that the
wizard wears or carries, subject to a maxi-
mum weight equal to 500 pounds of nonliv-
ing matter, or half that amount of living
matter, is transferred with the spellcaster.
Recovery from use of a dimension door
spell requires one round.

When this spell is cast, the wizard can cre-
ate a single emotional reaction in the subject
creatures. The following are typical:
1. Courage: This emotion causes the
creatures affected to become berserk, fight-
ing with a + 1 bonus to the attack dice, caus-
ing +3 points of damage, and temporarily
gaining 5 hit points. The recipients fight
without shield, and regardles of life, never

3. Friendship: The affected creatures
react more positively (e.g.. tolerance
becomes goodwill). It counters (and is coun-
tered by) hate.
4. Happiness: This effect creates joy and
a feeling of complacent well-being, adding
+4 to all reaction rolls and making attack
unlikely unless the creatures are subject to
extreme provocation. lt counters (and is
countered by) sadness.

more negatively (e.g., tolerance becomes
negative neutrality). 1t counters (and is
countered by) friendship.

morale, saving throw rolls, attack rolls. and
damage caused by +2. It counters (and is
countered by) hopelessness.
7. Hopelessness: The affected creatures
submit to the demands of any opponent:
surrender, get out, etc. Otherwise, the crea-
tures are 25% likely to do nothing in a
round, and 25% likely to tum back or

All creatures in the area at the instant the
spell is cast are affected unless successful
saving throws vs. spell are made, adjusted

wizard continues to concentrate on project-
ing the chosen emotion. Those who fail the
saving throw against fear must roll a new
saving throw if they retum to the affected
area.

iined bonus is +3 or less.
Wizard Spells (4th Level)

lose their enchantment when they success-
fully hit a target, but otherwise the spell

powdered lime and carbon.
Enervatlon (Necromancy)
Range: 10 yardsl level
Components: V, S
Duration: 1d4 hours + 1 hour/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell temporarily suppresses the sub-
ject's life force. The necromancer points his
finger and utters the incantation, releasing a
black bolt of crackling energy. The subject
must roll a saving throw vs. spell, adjusted
for Dexterity, to avoid the bolt. Success
means the spell has no effect. Failure means
the subject is treated exactly as if he had
been drained of energy levels by a wight,
one level for every four levels of the caster.
Hit Dice, spells, and other character details
dependent on level are lost or reduced.
Those drained to Oth level must make a sys-
tem shock check to survive and are helpless
until the spell expires. The spell effect even-
tually wears off, either after 1d4 hours plus
one hour per caster level, or after six hours
of complete and undisturbed rest. Level
abilities are regained, but lost spells must be
rememorized. Undead are immune to this
spell.
Evard's Black Tentacles
(Conjuration/Summoning)
Range: 30 yards
Components: V. S, M
Duration: 1 hour/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 30 sq. ft./level
Saving Throw: None
This spell creates many rubbery, black
tentacles in the area of effect. These waving
members seem to spring forth from the
earth, floor, or whatever surface is
underfoot—including water. Each tentacle
is 10 feet long, AC 4. and requires as many
points of damage to destroy as the level of
the wizard who cast the spell. There are 1d-1
such tentacles. plus one per experience level
of the spellcaster.
Any creature within range of the writhing
tentads is subject to attack as determined by
the DM. The target of a tentacle attack must
roll a saving throw vs. spell. If this succeeds,
the subject suffers ldé points of damage from
I57
contact with the tentacle, and thm the tentacle
is destroyed. Failure to save indimtes that the
damage inflicted is 2d4 points, the ebon mem-
ber is wrapped around its subject, and damage
will be 3d4 points on the second and sucoeed-
ing rounds. Since thse tentacles have no intel-
ligence to guide them. there is the possibility
that they entwine any object-—a tree, post. pil-
lar, even the wizard hirnself—or continue to
squeeze a dead opponent. A grasping hold
established by a tentacle remains until the ten-
tacle is destroyed by some form of attack or
until it disappears at the end of the spell's dura-
tion.
The component for this spell is a piece of
tentacle from a giant octopus or giant squid.
Extension I (Alteration)
Range: 0
Components: V
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
By use of an extension I spell, the wizard
prolongs the duration of a previously cast
1st-, Znd-. or 3rd-level spell by 50%. Thus,
a levitation spell can be made to function 15
minutes/level, a hold person spell made to
work for three rounds/level, etc. Naturally.
the spell affects only spells that have dura-
tions. This spell must be cast immediately
after the spell to be extended, either by the
original caster or another wizard. lf a com-
plete round or more elapses, the extension
fails and is wasted.
fear (Illusion/Phantasm)
Range: 0
Components: V. S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 60' long cone. 30' diameter
at end, 5' at base
Saving Throw: Neg.
When a fear spell is cast, the wizard sends
forth an invisible cone of terror that causes
creatures within its area of effect to tum
away from the caster and flee in panic.
Affected creatures are likely to drop what-
ever they are holding when struck by the
spell; the base chance of this is 60% at 1st
level (or at 1 Hit Die). and each level (or Hit
Die) above this reduces the probability by
5%. Thus at 10th level there is only a 15%
chance. and at 13th level no chance. of
dropping items. Creatures affected by fear
ﬂee at their fastest rate for a number of
melee rounds equal to the level of experi-
ence of the spellcaster. Undead and crea-
tures that successfully roll their saving
throws vs. the spell are not affected.
The material component of this spell is
either the heart of a hen or a white feather.



Wizard Spells (4th Level)
ﬁre Charm (Encltantment/Charm)
Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 15-foot radius of fire
Saving Throw: Neg.
By means of this spell the wizard causes a
normal fire source, such as a brazier, ﬂam-
beau, or bonfire, to serve as a magical
agent, for from this source he Causes a gos-
samer veil of multi-hued ﬂame to encircle
the fire at five feet distance. Any creatures
observing the fire or the dancing circle of
ﬂame around it must successfully roll a sav-
ing throw vs. spell or be chamied into
remaining motionless and gazing, trans-
fixed, at the ﬂames. While so charmed,
creatures are subject to suggestions of 12 or
fewer words, saving vs. spell with a -3 pen»
alty, adjusted for Wisdom. The caster can
give one such suggestion to each creature,
and the suggestions need not be the same.
The maximum duration for such a sugges-
tion is one hour, regardless of the caster's
level.
The fire charm is broken if the charmed
creature is physically attacked, if a solid
object comes between the creature and the
veil of ﬂames so as to obstruct vision, or
when the duration of the spell expires.
Those exposed to the fire charm again may
be affected at the DM's option, although
bonuses may also be allowed to the saving
throws. Note that the veil of ﬂame is not a
magical ﬁre, and passing through it incurs
the same damage as would be sustained
from passing through its original fire
source.
The material component for this spell is a
small piece of multi-colored silk of excep-
tional thinness that the spellcaster must
throw into the fire source.
Flre Shield (Evocation, Alteration)
Range: O
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
This spell can be cast in one of two
forms: a warm shield that protects against
cold-based attacks, or a chill shield that pro-
tects against fire~based attacks. Both return
damage to creatures making physical
attacks against the wizard. The wizard must
choose which variation he memorizes when
the spell is selected.
When casting this spell, the wizard
appears to immolate himself, but the ﬂames
are thin and wispy, shedding no heat,
though giving light equal to only half the
illumination of a normal torch. The color of
the ﬂames is determined randomly (50%
chance of either color)—blue or green if the
chill shield is cast, violet or blue if the wann
shield is employed. The special powers of
each shield are as follows:
A) Warm shield. The ﬂames are warm to
the touch. Any cold-based attacks are saved
against with a +2 bonus: either half normal
damage or no damage is sustained. There is
no bonus against fire-based attacks, but if
the wizard fails to make the required saving
throw (if any) against them, he sustains
double normal damage.
The material component for this varia-
tion is a bit of phosphorus.
B) Chill shield. The ﬂames are cool to the
touch. Any fire-based attacks are saved
against with a +2 bonus; either half normal
damage or no damage is sustained. There is
no bonus against cold-based attacks, but if
the wizard fails to make the required saving
throw (if any) apinst them, he sustains
double normal damage.
The material component for this varia-
tion is alive firefly or glow worm or the tail
portions of four dead ones.
Any creature striking the spellcaster with
its body or hand-held weapons inﬂicts nor-
mal damage upon the wizard, but the
attacker suffers the same amount of dam-
age. An attacker's magical resistance, if any,
is tested when the creature actually strikes
the wizard. Successful resistance shatters
the spell. Failure means the creature's magic
resistance does not affect that casting of the
spell .
flre Trap (Abjuration, Evocation)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent until discharged
Casting Time: 1 tum
Area of Effect: Object touched
Saving Throw: ‘/1
Any closeable item (book, box, bottle,
chest, Coffer, coffin, door, drawer, and so
forth) can be warded by a fire trap spell. The
spell is centered on a point selected by the
spellcaster. The item so trapped cannot have
a second closure or warding spell placed
upon it (if such is attempted, the result is
25% first spell fails, 25% second spell fails,
or 50% both spells fail). A knock spell does
not affect a fire trap in any way—as soon as
the offending party enters or touches the
item, the trap discharges. Thieves and oth-
ers have only 1/z of their normal chance to
detect a fire trap (by noticing the character-
istic markings required to cast the spell).
They have only 1/: their normal chance to
remove the trap (failure detonates the trap
immediately). An unsuccessful dispel does
not detonate the spell. The caster can use the
trapped object without discharging it, as
can any individual to whom the spell was
specifically attuned when cast (the exact
method usually involves a keyword). When
the trap is discharged. there is an explosion
of five-foot radius from the spell's center; all
creatures within this area must roll saving
throws vs. spell. Damage is 1d4 points plus
1 point per level of the caster; half this
(round up) for creatures successfully saving.
(Underwater, this ward inﬂicts half damage
and creates a large cloud of steam.) The item
trapped is not harmed by this explosion.
To place this spell, the caster must trace
the outline of the closure with a bit of sul-
phur or saltpeter and touch the center of the
effect. Attunement to another individual
requires a hair or similar object from that
person.
Fumble (Enchantment/Charm)
Range; 10 yards/ level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 30-foot cube
Saving Throw: Special
When a fumble spell is cast, the wizard
creates an area in which all creatures sud-
denly become clumsy and awkward. Run-
ning creatures trip and fall, those reaching
for an item drop it, those employing weap-
ons likewise awkwardly drop them, etc.
Recovery from a fall or to pick up a fumbled
object typically requires a successful saving
throw and takes one round. Note that
breakable items might suffer damage when
dropped. A subject succeeding with his sav-
ing throw can act freely that round, but if he
is in the area at the beginning of the next
round, another saving throw is required.
Altematively, the spell can be cast at an
individual creature. Failure to save means
the creature is affected for the spell's entire
duration; success means the creature is
slowed (see the 3rd-level spell).
The material component of this spell is a
dab of solidified milk fat.
tlalluclnatory Terraln
(Illusion/Phuitasin)
Range: 20 yards/level
Components: V. S. M
Duration: 1 hour/level
Casting Time: 1 tum
Area of Effect: Cube up to 30’ per sidel level
saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the wizard causes
an illusion that hides the actual terrain with-
in the area of effect. Thus open fields or a
road can be made to look like a swamp, hill,
crevasse, or some other difficult or impass-
able terrain. A pond can be made to look
like a grassy meadow, a precipice look like a
gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully made to



Wizard Spells
look like a wide and smooth road. The hal-
lucinatory terrain persists until a dispel
magic spell is cast upon the area or until the
duration expires. Individual creatures may
see through the illusion, but the illusion per-
sists, affecting others who observe the
scene.
lf the illusion involves only a subtle
change, such as causing an open wood to
appear thick and dark, or increasing the
slope of a hill, the effect may be unnoticed
even by those in the midst of it. lf the change
is extreme, a grassy plain covering a seeth-
ing field of volcanic mudpots, for instance.
the illusion will no doubt be noticed the
instant one person falls prey to it. Each level
of experience expands the dimensions of the
area affected, e.g., a 12th-level caster affects
a 120 yd. x 120 yd. x 120 yd. area.
The material components of this spell are
a stone, a twig, and a bit of green plant-—
leaf or grass blade.
Ice Storm (Evocatiorl)
Range: 10 yardsl level
Components: \/, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell can have one of two effects, at
the caster’s option: Either great hail stones
pound down for one round in a 40-foot-
diameter area and inflict 3d10 points of
damage to any creatures within the area of
effect, or driving sleet falls in an 80-foot-
diameter area for one round per caster level.
The sleet blinds creatures within its area for
the duration of the spell and causes the
ground in the area to be icy, thus slowing
movement by 50% and making it 50%
probable that a creature trying to move in
the area slips and falls. The sleet also extin-
guishes torches and small fires.
Note that this spell will negate a heat
metal spell.
The material components for this spell are
a pinch of dust and a few drops of water.
llltlilﬂndly Wall (Illusion/Pharrtasm)
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, $
Duration: Pennanent
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1' X 10' X 10'
Saving Throw: None
This spell creates the illusion of a wall,
floor, ceiling, or similar surface, which is
permanent until dispelled. It appears abso-
lutely real when viewed, even magically, as
with the clerical spell, tme seeing, or its
equivalent, but physical objects can pass
through it without difficulty. When the spell
is used to hide pits, traps, or normal doors,
normal demihuman and magical detection
abilities work normally, and touch or prob-
ing searches reveal the tnre nature of the
surface, though they do not cause the illu-
sion to disappear.
The material component is a rare dust
that costs at least 400 gp and requires four
days to prepare.
Improved Invlslblllty
(Illusion/Phantasm)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 4 rounds 4- 1 roundl level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
This spell is similar to the invisibility
spell, but the recipient is able to attack,
either by missile discharge, melee combat,
or spellcasting, and remain unseen. Note,
however, that there are sometimes telltale
traces, a shimmering, so that an observant
opponent can attack the invisible spell
recipient. These traces are only noticeable
when specifically looked for (after the invis-
ible character has made his presence
known). Attacks against the invisible char-
acter suffer — 4 penalties to the attack rolls,
and the invisible character's saving throws
are made with a +4 bonus. High Hit Dice
creatures that might notice invisible oppo-
nents Will notice a creature under this spell
as if they had 2 fewer Hit Dice (they roll sav-
ing throws vs. spell; success indicates they
spot the character).
leomund‘s Secure Shelter
(Alteration, Enchantment)
Range: 20 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1d4+1 hours + 1 hour/level
Casting Time: 4 tums
Area of Effect: 30 sq. ft./level
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the wizard to magically
call into being a sturdy cottage or lodge,
made of material that is common in the area
where the spell is cast—stone, timber, or (at
worst) sod. The floor area of the lodging is
30 square feet per level of the spellcaster,
and the surface is level, clean, and dry. In all
respects the lodging resembles a normal cot-
tage, with a sturdy door, two or more shut-
tered windows, and a small fireplace.
While the lodging is secure against winds
of up to 70 miles per hour, it has no heating
or cooling source (other than natural insula-
tion qualities). Therefore it must be heated
as a nonnal dwelling, and extreme heat
adversely affects it and its occupants. The
dwelling does, however. provide considera-
ble security otherwise, as it is as strong as a
I59
normal stone building, regardless of its
material composition, resists flames and fire
as if it were stone, and is impervious to nor-
mal missiles (but not the sort cast by siege
machinery or giants).
The door, shutters, and even chimney are
secure against intrusion, the former two
being wizard locked and the latter being
secured by a top grate of iron and a narrow
flue. ln addition. these three areas are pro-
tected by an alarm spell. Lastly, an unseen
servant is called up to provide service to the
spellcaster.
The inside of the shelter contains rude
fumishings as desired by the spellcaster—up
to eight bunks, a trestle table and benches,
as many as four chairs or eight stools, and a
writing desk.
The material components of this spell are
a square chip of stone, crushed lime, a few
grains of sand, a sprinkling of water, and
several splinters of wood. These must be
augmented by the components of the alarm
and unseen servant spells if these beneﬁts
are to be included (string and silver wire and
a small bell).
Magic Mirror (Enchantment, Divination)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1 hour
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the wizard changes
a nonnal mirror into a scrying device simi-
lar to a crystal ball. The details of the use of
such a scrying device are found in the DMG
under the description for the crystal ball.
The mirror used must be of finely
wrought and highly polished silver of a min-
imum cost not less than 1,000 gp. This mir-
ror is not harmed by casting the spell, but
the other material components—the eye of a
hawk, an eagle, or even a roc, and nitric
acid, copper, and zinc—are used up.
The following spells can be cast through a
magic mirror: comprehend languages, read
magic, tongues, and infravision. The fol-
lowing spells have a 5% chance per level of
the caster of operating correctly: detect
magic, detect good or evil, and message.
The base chances for the subject to detect
any crystal ball-like spell is listed in the crys-
tal ball entry in the DMG (see the ‘Miscella-
neous Magic" section).



Wizard Spells (4th
Nlassmorph (Alteration)
Range: 10 yardsl level
Components: V, S, M

Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast upon willing crea-
tures of man-size or smaller, up to 10 such
creatures per level of the caster can be magi-
cally altered to appear as trees of any sort.
Thus a company of creatures can be made to
appear as a copse, grove, or orchard. Fur-
thermore, these massmorphed creatures can
be passed through—and even touched—by
other creatures without revealing their true
nature. Note, however, that blows to the
creature-trees cause damage, and blood can
be seen.
Creatures to be massmorphed must be
within the spell's area of effect and unwilling
creatures are not affected. Affected crea-
tures remain unmoving but aware, subject
to normal sleep requirements. and able to
see. hear, and feel for as long as the spell is in
effect. The spell persists until the caster
commands it to cease or until a dispel magic
spell is cast upon the creatures. Creatures
left in this state for extended periods are
subject to insects, weather, disease, fire, and
other natural hazards.
The material component of this spell is a
handful of bark chips from the type of tree
the creatures are to become.
Minor Creation (Illusion/Phantasm)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 hour/ level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the wizard to create an
item of non-living, vegetable nature-—soft
goods, rope, wood, etc. The caster actually
pulls wisps of material of the plane of
Shadow from the air and weaves them into
the desired item. The volume of the item
created cannot exceed one cubic foot per
level of the spellcaster. The item remains in
existence for only as long as the spell's dura-
tion.
The spellcaster must have at least a tiny
piece of matter of the same type of item he
plans to create by means of the minor crea-
tion spell—a bit of twisted hemp to create
rope. a splinter of wood to create a door.
and so forth.

Mlnor Globe of lnvulnerablllty
(Abjuration)
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 5-foot-radius sphere
Saving Throw: None
This spell creates an immobile, faintly
shimmering magical sphere around the
caster that prevents any 1st-, Znd-. or 3rd-
level spell effects from penetrating (i.e.. the
area of effect of any such spells does not in-
clude the area of the minor globe of invul-
nerability). This includes innate abilities
and effects from devices. However, any
type of spell can be cast out of the magical
sphere, and these pass from the caster of the
globe to their subject without affecting the
minor globe. Fourth and higher level spells
are not affected by the globe. The globe can
be brought down by a successful dispel
magic spell. The caster can leave and retum
to the globe without penalty. Note that spell
effects are not actually disrupted by the
globe unless cast directly through or into
it: The caster would still see a minor image
created by a wizard outside the globe. If that
wizard then entered the globe, the images
would wink out, to reappear when the wiz-
ard exited the globe. Likewise, a wizard
standing in the area of a light spell would
still receive sufficient light for vision, even
though that part of the light spell volume in
the globe would not be luminous.
The material component of the spell is a
glass or crystal bead that shatters at the ex-
piration of the spell.
Monster Summoning ll
(Coniuration/Summoning)
Range: 40 yards
Components: V. S, M
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell is much like the 3rd-level mon-
sfer summoning I spell, except that this spell
summons 1d6 Znd-level monsters. These ap-
pear anywhere within the spell range and at-
tack the casters opponents, until he
commands them to cease, the spell duration
expires, or the monsters are slain. These
creatures do not check morale; they vanish
when slain. If no opponent exists to fight
and the wizard can communicate with
them. the summoned monsters can perform
other services for the summoning wizard.
The material components of this spell are
a tiny bag and a small (not necessarily lit)
candle.
I60
Otllulte’s Reslllent Sphere
(Alteration, Evocation)
Range: Z0 yards
Components: V, S. M
Duration: 1 round/ level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1-foot diameter/ level
Saving Throw: Neg.
When this spell is cast, the result is a globe
of shimmering force that encloses the sub-
ject creature—if it is small enough to fit
within the diameter of the sphere and it fails
to successfully save vs. spell. The resilient
sphere contains its subject for the spell's du-
ration, and it is not subject to damage of any
sort except from a rod of cancellation, a
wand of negation, or a disintegrate or dispel
magic spell. These cause it to be destroyed
without harm to the subject. Nothing can
pass through the sphere, inside or out,
though the subject can breathe normally.
The subject may stmggle, but all that occurs
is a movement of the sphere. The globe can
be physically moved either by people out-
side the globe or by the struggles of those
within.
The material components of the spell are
a hemispherical piece of diamond (or similar
hard, clear gem material) and a matclung
hemispherical piece of gum arabic.
Phantasmal ltlller (Illusion/Phantum)
Range: 5 yards/ level
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 roundl level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special
When this spell is cast, the wizard creates
the illusion of the most fearsome thing
imaginable to the victim, simply by forming
the fears of the victim's subconscious mind
into something that its consdous mind can
visualize—the most horrible beast. Only the
spell recipient can see the phantasmal killer
(the caster sees only a shadowy shape), but
if it succeeds in scoring a hit, the subject dies
from fright. The beast attacks as a 4 Hit Dice
monster. lt is invulnerable to all attacks,
and it can pass through any barriers. Once
cast, it inexorably pursues the subject, for it
exists only in the subject's mind.
The only defenses against a phantasmal
killer are an attempt to disbelieve (which
can be tried but once), slaying or rendering
unconscious the wizard who cast the spell,
or rendering unconscious the target of the
spell for its duration. To disbelieve the killer,
the subject must specifically state the at-
tempt and then roll an lntelligence check.
This roll has a -1 penalty for every four
levels of the caster.



Special modiﬁers apply to this attack:
Condition Modifier
Surprise “ Z
Subject previously attacked by
this spell + 1/
Subject is an illusionist +2
Subject is wearing a helm of telepathy +3
Magic resistance, bonuses against fear.
and Wisdom adjustments also apply. Magic
resistance is checked first to determine spell
operation, and then the fear/Wisdom bonus
applies as a minus to the dice roll to match
or score less than Intelligence.
It the subject of a phantasmal killer attack
succeeds in disbelieving. and he is wearing a
helm of telepathy, the beast can be tumed
upon the wizard, who must then disbelieve
it or be subject to its attack and possible
effects.
If the subject ignores the killer to perform
other actions, such as attacking the caster,
the killer may, at the DM's option, gain
bonuses to hit (for flank or rear attacks,
etc.). Spells such as remove fear and cloak
of bravery, cast after the killer has attacked,
grant another check to disbelieve the effect.
Plant Growth (Alteration)
Range: 10 yards/level
Components: V, S
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: An area 10' per side/level
Saving Throw: None
Vi/hen a plimtgrowth spell is cast, the wiz-
ard causes normal vegetation to grow.
entwine, and entangle to form a thicket or
jungle that creatures must hack or force a
way through at a movement rate of 1 per
round (or 2 if larger than rnan-sized). The
area must contain brush and trees for this
spell to work. Briars, bushes, creepers.
lianas, roots. saplings, thistles, thorn, trees.
vines, and weeds become thick and over-
grown so as to form a barrier. The area of
effect is 10 feet on a side per level of experi-
ence of the caster, in any square or rectangu-
lar shape that the caster desires. Thus an
8th-level wizard can affect an 80’ X 80'
square, a 160' X 40' rectangle, a 640' X 10’
rectangle, etc. Individual plant girth and
height is generally affected less than thick-
ness of brush, branch, and undergrowth.
The spell's effects persist in the area until it is
cleared by labor, fire, or such magical
means as a dispel magic spell.

Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.
The polymorph other spell is a powerful
magic that completely alters the form and
ability, and possibly the personality and
mentality, of the recipient. Of course, while
a creature with a lower Intelligence can be
polymorphed in form into something with a
higher Intelligence, it will not gain that crea-
ture's mental ability. The reverse—poly-
morphing a higher Intelligence creature into
one of significantly lower Intelligence-
results in a creature much more intelligent
than appearances would lead one to believe.
The polymorphed creature must succeed on
a system shock (see Table 3) roll to see if it
survives the change. After this, it must
make a special Intelligence check to see if it
retains its personality (see following).
The polymorphed creature acquires the
form and physical abilities of the creature it
has been polymorphed into. while retaining
its own mind. Form includes natural Armor
Class (that due to skin toughness, but not
due to quickness. magical nature. etc.).
physical movement abilities (walking.
swimming, ﬂight with win§, but not plane
shifting, blinking, teleporting, etc.). and
attack routines (claw/claw/bite. swoop.
rake, constriction, but not petrification,
breath weapons, energy drain, etc.). Hit
points and saving throws do not change
from the original form. Noncorporeal forms
cannot be assumed. Natural shapeshifters
(Iycanthropes, dopplegangers, higher level
druids. etc.) are affected for but one round.
and can then resume their normal form.
If slain, the polymorphed creature reverts
to its original form (it's still dead, though).
(Note that most creatures generally prefer
their own form and will not willingly stand
the risk of being subjected to this spell!) As
class and level are not attributes of form,
abilities derived from either cannot be
gained by this spell, nor can exact ability
scores be specified.
When the polymorph occurs. the crea-
ture's equipment, if any, melds into the new
form (in particularly challenging cam-
paigns, the DM may allow protective
devices, such as a ring of protection, to con-
tinue operating effectively). The creature
retains its mental abilities, including spell
use, assuming the new form allows comple-
tion of the proper verbal and somatic com-
ponents and the material components are
available. Creatures not used to a new form
might be penalized at the DM's option (e.g.,
"2 to attack rolls) until they practice suffi-
ciently to master it.
I6!
When the physical change occurs, there is
a base 100% chance that the subject's per-
sonality and mentality change into that of
new form (i.e., a roll of 20 or less on 1d2O).
For each 1 point of Intelligence of the sub-
iect, subtract 1 from the base chance on
1d20. Additionally, for every Hit Die of clif-
ference between the original form and the
form it is assuming, add or subtract 1
(depending on whether polymorphed form
has more Hit Dice (or levels] or fewer Hit
Dice [or levels] than original, respectively).
The chance for assumption of the personali-
ty and mentality of the new form is checked
daily until the change takes place.
A subject acquiring the mentality of the
new form has effectively become the crea-
ture whose fonn was assumed and comes
under the control of the DM until recovered
by a wish spell or similar magic. Once this
final change takes place, the creature
acquires the new form's full range of magi-
cal and special abilities.
Example: If a 1 Hit Die orc of 8 Intelli-
gence is polymorphed into a white dragon
with 6 Hit Dice, for example, it is 85% (20 -
Blntelligence + 5 level difference [6-1] = 17
out of 20 = 85%) likely to actually become
one in all respects. but in any case it has the
dragon's physical and mental capabilities. If
it does not assume the personality and men-
tality of a white dragon, it knows what it
fon-nerly knew as well. '
The wizard can use a dispel magic spell to
change the polymorphed creature back to
its original from, and this requires a system
shock roll. Those who have lost their indi-
viduality and are then converted back main-
tain the belief that they are actually the
polymorphed creature and attempt to
return to that form. Thus the orc who comes
to believe he is a white dragon, when con-
verted back to his orc form, steadfastly
maintains he is really a white dragon poly-
morphed into the shape of an orc. His com-
panions will most likely consider him mad.
The material component of this spell is a
caterpillar cocoon.
Polymorph Self (Alteration)
Range: 0
Components: V
Duration: 2 turnsl level
Casting Time; 4
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, the wizard is able
to assume the form of any creature, save
those that are noncorporeal, from as small
as a wren to as large as a hippopotamus.
Furthermore, the wizard gains its physical
mode of locomotion and breathing as well.
No system shock roll is required. The spell
does not give the new form's other abilities
(attack, magic, special movement. etc.). nor



does it run the risk of changing personality
and mentality.
When the polymorph occurs, the caster’s
equipment, if any, melds into the new form
(in particularly challenging campaigns, the
DM may allow protective devices, such as a
ring of protection, to continue operating
effectively). The caster retains all mental
abilities, including spell use, assuming the
new form allows completion of the proper
verbal and somatic components and the
material components are available. A caster
not used to a new form might be penalized
at the DM's option (e.g., -2 penalty to
attack rolls) until he practices sufficiently to
master it.
Thus a wizard changed into an owl could
fly, but his vision would be human; a
change to a blade pudding would enable
movement under doors or along halls and
ceilings, but not the pudding's offensive
(acid) or defensive capabilities. Naturally.
the strength of the new forrn is sufficient to
enable normal movement. The spellcaster
can change his form as often as desired for
the duration of the spell. each change
requiring a round. The wizard retains his
own hit points, attack rolls, and saving
throws. The wizard can end the spell at any
time; when voluntarily retuming to his own
form and ending the spell, he regains 1d12
hit points. The wizard also will retum to his
own form when slain or when the effect is
dispelled, but no hit points are restored in
these cases.
Rainbow Pattern
(Alteratiom illusion/Phantasm)
Range: 10 yards
Components: S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 30-foot cube
Saving Throw: Neg.
By means of this spell, the wizard creates
a glowing, rainbow-hued band of inter-
weaving patterns. Any creature caught in it
may become fascinated and gaze at it as
long as the effect lasts. The spell can capti-
vate a maximum of 24 levels, or Hit Dice, of
0'eatures—24 creatures with 1 Hit Die each,
12 with 2 Hit Dice, etc. All creatures affect-
ed must be within the area of effect, and
each is entitled to a saving throw vs. spell.
An attack on an affected creature that
causes damage frees it from the spell imme-
diately. Creatures that are restrained and
removed from the area still try to follow the
pattem.
Once the rainbow pattem is cast, the wiz-
ard need only gesture in the direction he
desires, and the pattern of colors moves
slowly off in that direction, at the rate of 30
feet per round. lt persists without further
attention from the spellcaster for 1d3
l
" Wizard Spells (4th level)
rounds. All affected creatures follow the
moving rainbow of light. If the pattem leads
its subjects into a dangerous area (through
ﬂame, off a cliff, etc.), allow a second sav-
ing throw. If the view of the lights is com-
pletely blocked (by an ohscurement spell,
for instance), the spell is negated.
The wizard need not utter a sound, but he
must gesture appropriately while holding a
crystal prism and the material component, a
piece of phosphor.
llary's Mnemonlc Enhancer

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 day
Casting Time: 1 tu.rr\
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the wizard is able
to memorize, or retain the memory of, three
additional spell levels (three 1st-level spells,
or one 1st and one 2nd, or one 3rd-level
spell). The wizard has two options:
A) Memorize additional spells, This
option is taken at the time the spell is cast.
The additional spells must be memorized
normally and any material components
must be acquired.
B) Retain memory of any spell (within the
level limits) cast the round prior to starting
to cast this spell, The round after a spell is
cast, the enhancer must be successfully cast.
This restores the previously cast spell to
memory. Any material components must be
acquired by the caster, however.
The material components of the spell are
a piece of string, an ivory plaque of at least
100 gp value, and ink consisting of squid
secretion with either black dragon's blood
or giant slug digestive juice. These disap-
pear when the spell is cast,
Remove Curse (Abluration)
Reversible
Range: Touch
Components: V, 5
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special
Upon casting this spell. the wizard is usu-
ally able to remove a curse—whether it is on
an object, or a person, or in the form of
some undesired sending or evil presence.
Note that the remove curse spell cannot
affect a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of
armor, for example, although it usually
enables a person afflicted with a cursed item
to be rid of it. Certain special curses may not
be countered by this spell, or may be coun-
tered only by a caster of a certain level or
I61
more. A caster of 12th level or more can
cure lycanthropy with this spell by casting it
on the animal form. The were-creature
receives a saving throw vs. spell and, if suc-
cessful, the spell fails and the wizard must
gain a level before attempting the remedy
again.
The reverse of the spell is not pen-nanent;
the bestow curse lasts for one tum for every
experience level of the wizard casting the
spell. lt causes one of the following effects
(roll percentile dice):
D100
Roll Result
1-50 Lowers one ability of the subject to
3 (the DM determines which by
random selection)
51-75 Worsens the subject's attack rolls
and saving throws by -4
76-O0 Makes the subject 50% likely per
tum to drop whatever it is holding
(or simply do nothing. in the case
of creatures not using tools)
lt is possible for a wizard to devise his
own curse, and it should be similar in power
to those given (the DM has final say). The
subject of a bestow curse spell must be
touched. If the subject is touched, a saving
throw is still applicable; if it is successful,
the effect is negated. The bestowed curse
cannot be dispelled.
Shadow Monsters (illusionlﬂiantasm)
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 20-foot cube
Saving Throw: Special
A wizard casting the shadow monsters
spell uses material from the plane of
Shadow to shape semi-real illusions of one
or more monsters. The total Hit Dice of the
shadow monster or monsters thus created
cannot exceed the level of experience of the
wizard; thus a 10th-level wizard can create
one creature that has 10 Hit Dice, two that
have 5 Hit Dice. etc. All shadow monsters
created by one spell must be of the same
sort. The actual hit point total for each
monster is 20% of the hit point total it
would normally have. (To detennine this.
roll the appropriate Hit Dice and multiply
the hit points by .2. Any remainder less than
.4 is dropped—in the case of monsters with
1 or fewer Hit Dice, this indicates the mon-
ster was not successfully created—and
scores between .4 and 1 are rounded up to 1
hit point.)
Those viewing the shadow monsters are
allowed to disbelieve as per normal illu-
sions, although there is a -2 penalty to the
attempt. The shadow monsters perform as
the real monsters with respect to Armor



Class and attack forms. Those who believe
in the shadow monsters suffer real damage
from their attacks. Spedal attack forms
such as petrification or level drain do not
actually occur, but a subject who believes
they are real will react appropriately.
Those who roll successful saving throws
see the shadow monsters as transparent
images superimposed on vague shadowy
forms. These are Armor Class 10 and inflict
only 20% of normal melee damage (biting.
clawing, weapon, etc.), dropping fractional
damage less than .4 as done with hit points.
Example: A shadow monster griffon
attacks a person who knows it is only quasi-
real. The monster strikes with two claw
attacks and one bite, hitting as a 7-Hit Die
monster. All three attacks hit, and the nor-
mal damage dice are rolled, multiplied by .2
separately, rounded up or down, then added
together to get total damage. Thus if the
attacks score 4, 2, and 11 points, then a total
of 4 points of damage is inflicted (4 X .2 =
.8 [rounded to 1], 2 X .2 I .4 [rounded to
1], 11 X .2 I 2.2[rounded to2]. The sum is
1 4' 1 + Z I 4).
Shout (Evocatlon)
RJIIQE: O
Components: V,M
Duration: instantaneous
Casting Time; 1
Area of Effect: 10-foot X 30-foot cone
Saving Throw: Special
When a shout spell is cast, the wizard
gives himself tremendous vocal powers.
The caster can emit an ear-splitting noise
that has a principal effect in a cone shape
radiating from his mouth to a point 30 feet
away. Any creature within this area is deaf-
ened for 2d6 rounds and suffers 2d6 points
of damage. A successful saving throw vs.
spell negates the deafness and reduces the
damage by half. Any exposed brittle or
crystal substance subject to sonic vibrations
is shattered by a shout, while those brittle
objects in the possession of a creature
receive the creature's saving throw. Deaf-
ened creatures suffer a -1 penalty to sur-
prise rolls, and those that cast spells with
verbal components are 20% likely to mis-
cast them.
The shout spell cannot penetrate the 2nd-
level clerical spell, silence, 10’ radius. This
spell can be employed but once per day, for
otherwise the caster might permanently
deafen himself.
The material components for this spell are
a drop of honey, a drop of citric acid, and a
small cone made from a bull or ram hom,
Wizard Spells (4th Level)
Solld fog (Alteration)
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2d4 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 20' X 10' X 10' volume/
level of caster
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast. the wizard creates
a billowing mass of misty vapors similar to
a wall of fog spell. The caster can create less
vapor if desired. as long as a rectangular or
cubic mass at least 10 feet on a side is
formed. The fog obscures all sight, nonnal
and infravision, beyond two feet. However.
unlike normal fog, only a very strong wind
can move these vapors, and any creature
attempting to move through the solid fog
progresses at a rate of but one foot per
movement rate of 1 per round. A gust of
wind spell cannot affect it. A fireball, flame
strike, or a wall of fire can bum it away in a
single round.
The material components for the spell are
a pinch of dried, powdered peas combined
with powdered animal hoof.
Stonesltln (Alteration)
Range: Touch
Components: V, 5, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, the affected crea-
ture gains a virtual immunity to any attack
by cut, blow. projectile, or the like. Even a
sword of sharpness cannot affect a creature
protected by stoneskin, nor can a rock
hurled by a giant, a snakes strike, etc. How-
ever. magical attacks from such spells as
fireball, magic missile, lightning bolt, and
so forth have their normal effects. The spell
blocks 1d4 attacks, plus one attack per two
levels of experience the caster has achieved.
This limit applies regardless of attack rolls
and regardless of whether the attack was
physical or magical. For example, a
stoneskin spell cast by a 9th-level wizard
would protect against from five to eight
attacks. An attacking griffon would reduce
the protection by three each round; four
magic missiles would count as four attacks
in addition to inﬂicting their normal dam-
age.
The material components of the spell are
granite and diamond dust sprinkled on the
recipient's skin.
I63
Vacancy (Alteration, Illusion/Phantasm)
Range: IO yardsl level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 hour/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 10-foot radiusl level
Saving Throw: None
When a vacancy spell is cast, the wizard
causes an area to appear to be vacant,
neglected, and unused. Those who behold
the area see dust on the floor, cobwebs, dirt,
and other conditions typical of a long-
abandoned place. If they pass through the
area of effect, they seem to leave tracks, tear
away cobwebs, and so on. Unless they actu-
ally contact some object cloaked by the
spell, the place appears empty. Merely
bnishing an invisible object does not cause
the vacancy spell to be disturbed: Only
forceful contact grants a chance to note that
all is not as it seems.
if forceful contact with a cloaked object
occurs, those creatures subject to the spell
can penetrate the spell only if they discover
several items that they cannot see; each
being is then entitled to a saving throw vs.
spell. Failure means they believe that the
objects are invisible. A dispel magic spell
cancels this spell so that the tnie area is seen.
A true seeing spell, a gem of seeing, and sim-
ilar effects can penetrate the deception, but
a detect invisibility spell cannot.
This spell is a very powerful combination
of invisibility and illusion, but it can doak
only nonliving things. Living things are not
made invisible, but their presence does not
otherwise disturb the spell.
The wizard must have a square of the fin-
est black silk to cast this spell. This material
component must be worth at least 100 gp
and is used up during spellcasting.
Wall ol Flre (Evocation)
Range: 60 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
The wall of fire spell brings forth an
immobile, blazing curtain of magical fire of
shimmering color—violet or reddish-blue.
The spell creates either an opaque sheet of
flame up to one 20-foot square per level of
the spellcaster. or a ring with a radius of up
to 10 feet + five feet per two levels of expe-
rience of the wizard. In either fonn, the wall
of fire is 20 feet high.
The wall of fire must be cast so that it is
vertical with respect to the caster. One side
of the wall, selected by the caster, sends
forth waves of heat, inflicting 2d4 points of
damage upon creatures within 10 feet and
1d4 points of damage upon those within 20



feet. In addition, the wall inﬂicts 2d6 points
of damage, plus 1 point of damage per level
of the spellcaster, upon any creature passing
through it. Creatures especially subject to
fire may take additional damage, and
undead always take twice normal damage.
Note that attempting to catch a moving
creature with a newly-created wall of fire is
difficult; a successful saving throw enables
the creature to avoid the wall, while its rate
and direction of movement determine
which side of the created wall it is on. The
wall of fire lasts as long as the wizard con-
cmitrates on mai.ntaini.ng it, or one round
per level of experience of the wizard, in the
event he does not wish to concentrate upon
it.
The material component of the spell is
phosphorus.
Wall of Ice (Evocation)
Range: 10 yards/level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 tum/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell can be cast in one of three
ways: as an anchored plane of ice, as a
hemisphere, or as a horizontal sheet to fall
upon creatures with the effect of an ice
storm.
A) Ice plane. When this spell is cast, a
sheet of strong, hard ice is a-eated. The wall
is primarily defensive, stopping pursuers
and the like. The wall is one inch thick per
level of experience of the wizard. It covers a
10-foot-square area per level (B 10th-level
wizard can create a wall of ice up to 100 feet
long and 10 feet high or SO feet long and 20
feet high, etc.). Any creature breaking
through the ice suffers 2 points of damage
per inch of thickness of the wall. Fire-using
creatures suffer 3 points of damage per inch,
while cold-using creatures suffer only 1
point of damage per inch when breaking
through. The plane can be oriented in any
fashion as long as it is anchored along one or
more sides.
Bl Hemisphere. This casting of the spell
creates a hemisphere whose maximum radi-
us is equal to three feet plus one foot per
caster level. Thus a 7th-level caster can cre-
ate a hemisphere 10 feet in radius. The herni-
sphere lasts until it is broken, dispelled, or
melted. Note that it is possible, but difficult,
to trap mobile opponents under the hemi-
sphere.
C) Ice sheet. This casting of the spell
causes a horizontal sheet to fall upon oppo-
nents. The sheet covers a 10-foot-square
area per caster level. The sheet has the same
effect as an ice storrn's hail stones—3d10
points of damage inﬂicted to creatures
beneath it.
A wall of ice cannot form in an area occu-
pied by physical objects or creatures; its sur-
face must be smooth and unbroken when
created. Magical fires such as fireballs and
fiery dragon breath melt a wall of ice in one
round, though this creata a great cloud of
steamy fog that lasts one turn. Normal fires
or lesser magical ones do not hasten the
melting of a wall of ice.
The material component of this spell is a
small piece of quartz or similar rock crystal.
Wizard Eye (Alteration)
Range: O
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 roundl level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is employed, the wizard
creates an invisible sensory organ that sends
him visual information. The wizard eye
travels at 30 feet per round if viewing an
area ahead as a human would (i.e., primari-
ly looking at the ﬂoor). or 10 feet per round
if examining the ceiling and walls as well as
the floor ahead. The wizard eye can see with
int’-ravision up to 10 feet, and with normal
vision up to 60 feet away in brightly lit
areas. The wizard eye can travel in any
direction as as long as the spell lasts. It has
substance and a form that can be detected
(by a detect invisibility spell, for instance).
Solid barriers prevent the passage of a wiz-
ard eye, although it can pass through a
space no smaller than a small mouse hole
(one inch in diameter).
Using the eye requires the wizard to con-
centrate. However, if his concentration is
broken the spell does not end—the eye
merely becomes inert until the wizard again
concentrates, subject to the duration of the
spell. The powers of the eye cannot be
enhanced by other spells or items. The cast-
er is subject to any gaze attack met by the
eye. A successful dispel cast on the wizard
or eye ends the spell. With respect to blind-
ness, magical darkness, and so on, the wiz-
ard eye is considered an independent sen-
sory organ of the caster.
The material component of the spell is a
bit of bat fur.

Saving Throw: Special
This spell is essentially a spectral forces
spell that operates through a program (simi-
lar to a programmed illusion spell) deter-
mined by the caster. lt is thus unnecessary
for the wizard to concentrate on the spell for
longer than the round of casting it, as the
program has then started and will continue
without supervision. The illusion has vis-
ual, audio, olfactory, and thermal compo-
nents. lf any viewer actively attempts to
disbelieve the spell. he gains a saving throw

lieves and communicates this fact to other
viewers, each such viewer gains a saving

Airy Water (Alteration)
Range: O
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 tum/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 10' radius sphere or
15' radius hemisphere
Saving Throw: None
The airy water spell tums normal liquid.
such as water or water-based solutions, into
a less dense, breathable substance. Thus, if
the wizard wanted to enter an underwater
place, he would step into the water, cast the
spell and sink downward in a globe of bub-
bling water. He and any companions in the
spell's area of effect can move freely and
breathe just as if the bubbling water were
air. The globe is centered on and moves with
the caster. Water-breathing creatures avoid
a sphere (or hemisphere) of airy water, al-
though intelligent ones can enter it if they
are able to move by means other than swim-
ming. No water-breathers can breathe in an
area affected by this spell. There is only one
word that needs to be spoken to actuate the
magic, thus it can be cast underwater. The
spell does not filter or remove solid particles
of matter.
The material component of the spell is a
small handful of alkaline or bromine salts.
Animal Growth (Alteration)
Reversible
Range: 60 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Up to 8 animals in a 20’ cube
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, the wizard causes
all designated animals, up to a maximum of
eight, within a 20-foot-square area to grow
to twice their normal size. The effects of this
growth are doubled Hit Dice (with improve-
ment in attack rolls) and doubled damage in
combat. The spell lasts for one round for
each level of experience of the wizard cast-
ing the spell. Qnly natural animals, includ-
ing giant forms, can be affected by this spell.
The reverse, shrink animal, reduces ani-
mal size by half and likewise reduces Hit
Dice, attack damage, etc.
The component of both versions of the
ipell is a pinch of powdered bone.
Animate Dead (Necromancy)
Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 5 rounds
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell creates the lowest of the undead
monsters—skeletons or zombies—usually
from the bones or bodies of dead humans.
demihumans, or humanoids. The spell
causes existing remains to become animated
and obey the simple verbal commands of
the caster. The skeletons or zombies can fol-
low the caster, remain in an area and attack
any creature (or just a specific type of crea-
ture) entering the place, etc. The undead re-
main animated until they are destroyed in
combat or are tumed: the magic cannot be
dispelled. The following types of dead crea-
tures can be animated:
A) Humans. demihumans. and human-
oids with 1 Hit Die. The wizard can animate
one skeleton for each experience level he has
attained, or one zombie for every two
levels. The experience levels. if any, of the
slain are ignored; the body of a newly dead
9th-level fighter is animated as a zombie
with 2 Hit Dice. without special class or ra-
cial abilities.
B) Creatures with more than 1 Hit Die.
The number of undead animated is deter-
mined by the monster Hit Dice (the total Hit
Dice cannot exceed the wizards level). Skel-
etal forms have the Hit Dice of the original
creature, while zombie forms have one
more Hit Die. Thus, a 12th-level wizard
could anirrmte four zombie gnolls (4 X [2 +
1 Hit Dice] = 12), or a single fire giant skele-
ton. Such undead have none of the special
abilities they had in life.
C) Creatures with less than 1 Hit Die. The
caster can animate two skeletons per level
or one zombie per level. The creatures have
their normal Hit Dice as skeletons and an
additional Hit Die as zombies. Clerics re-
ceive a + 1 bonus when trying to turn these.
This spell assumes that the bodies or
bones are available and are reasonably in-
tact (those of skeletons or zombies de-
stroyed in combat won't bel).
lt requires a drop of blood and a pinch of
bone powder or a bone shard to complete
the spell. The casting of this spell is not a
good act and only evil wizards use it fri.~
quently.

Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Up to 3-foot cube
Saving Throw: Special
By means of this spell, the caster sets up a
natural repulsion between the affected ob-
ject and all other living things except him-
self. Thus any living creature attempting to
touch the affected object is repulsed (unable
to come closer than one foot), or repulses
the affected object, depending on the rela-
tive mass of the two (a halfling attempting
to touch an iron chest with an avoidance
spell upon it will be thrown back, while the
chest will skitter away from a giant-sized
creature as the creature approaches).
The material component for the spell is a
magnetized needle. The spell cannot be cast
upon living things; any attempt to cast
avoidance upon the apparel or possessions
of a living creature entitles the subject crea-
ture to a saving throw vs. spell.
The reverse of this spell, attraction, uses
the same material components and sets up a
natural attraction between the affected ob-
ject and all living things. A creature is
drawn to the object if the creature is smaller.
or the object slides toward the creature if the
creature is larger. A successful bend bars roll
must be rolled to remove the enchanted ob-
ject once it has adhered to an object or Crea-
ture.
llgby’s lnterposlng Hand (ivuutiqn)
Range: 10 yards/level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round/ level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
Bigby's interposing hand is a man-sized to
gargantuan-sized magical hand that appears
between the spellcaster and his chosen op-
ponent. This disembodied hand then moves
to remain between the two, regardless of
what the spellcaster does or how the oppo-
nent tries to get around it. Neither invisibil-
ity nor polymorph fools the hand once a
creature has been chosen. The hand does
not pursue an opponent, nor does it move
more than ten feet away from the caster.
The size of the hand is detennined by the
wizard. and it can be human-sized (five feet)
all the way up to titan-sized (25 feet). lt pro-
vides cover for the caster against the se-
lected opponent, with all the attendant
combat adjustments. It has as many hit
points as the caster in full health and has an
Armor Class of O.



Any creature weighing less than 2,000
pounds trying to push past it is slowed to ‘/1
normal movement. If the original opponent
is slain, the caster can designate a new oppo-
nent for the hand. The caster can command
the hand out of existence at any time.
The material component of the spell is a
soft glove.
Chaos (Enchantment/Charm)
Range: 5 yardsl level
Components: V, 5, M
Duration: 1 roundl level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Up to 40-foot cube
Saving Throw: Special
This spell is similar to the 4th-level confu-
sion spell, but only the following beings
receive a saving throw: fighters, wizards
specialized in enchantments, monsters that
use no magic and have an lntelligence of 4 or
less, creatures of 21 Intelligence or higher,
and creatures with more levels or Hit Dice
than the caster's level.
The spell causes disorientation and severe
perceptual distortion, creating indecision
and the inability to take effective action.
The spell affects 1d4 creatures, plus one
creature per caster level. Those allowed sav-
ing throws roll them vs. spell with -Z pen-
alties, adjusted for Wisdom. Those who
successfully save are unaffected by the spell.
Affected creatures react as follows:
D10 Roll Action
1 Wander away (unless prevented)
for duration of spell
2-6 Stand confused one round
(then roll again)
7-9 Attack nearest creature for one
round (then roll again)
10 Act normally for one round
(then roll again)
The spell lasts one round for each level of
the caster. Those affected are checked by the
DM for actions each round for the duration
of the spell, or until the "wander away for
the duration of the spell" result occurs.
Wandering creatures move as far from the
caster as possible using their most typical
mode of movement (characters walk, fish
swim, bats fly, etc.). Saving throws and
actions are checked at the beginning of each
round. Any confused creature that is
attacked perceives the attacker as an enemy
and acts according to its basic nature.
The material component for this spell is a
small disc of bronze and a small rod of iron.
Cloudltlll (Evocation)
Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time; 5
Area of Effect: 40’ wide, 20' high,
Z0’ deep cloud
Saving Throw: None
This spell generates a billowing cloud of
ghastly yellowish green vapors that is so
toxic as to slay any creature with fewer than
4 + 1 Hit Dice, cause creatures with 4 + 1 to
5 + 1 Hit Dice to roll saving throws vs. poi-
son with -'4 penalties or be slain, and crea-
tures up to 6 Hit Dice (inclusive) to roll
unmodified saving throws vs. poison or be
slain. Holding one's breath has no effect on
the lethality of the spell. Those above 6th
level (or 6 Hit Dice) must leave the cloud
immediately or suffer 1d1O points of poison
damage each rotmd while in the area of
effect.
The cloudkill moves away from the spell-
caster at 10 feet per round, rolling along the
surface of the ground. A moderate breeze
causes it to alter course (roll for direction).
but it does not move back toward its caster.
A strong wind breaks it up in four rounds,
and a greater wind force prevents the use of
the spell. Very thick vegetation will disperse
the cloud in two rounds. As the vapors are
heavier than air, they sink to the lowest
level of the land, even pour down den or
sinkhole openings: thus the spell is ideal for
slaying nests of giant ants, for example. lt
cannot penetrate liquids, nor can it be cast
underwater.
Cone of Cold (Evocation)
Range: O
Components: V. S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: ‘/2
When this spell is cast, it causes a cone-
shaped area of extreme cold. originating at
the wizard’s hand and extending outward in
a cone ﬁve feet long and one foot in diame-
ter per level of the caster. lt drains heat and
causes 1d4 + 1 points of damage per level of
experience of the wizard. For example. a
10th-level wizard would cast a cone of cold
10 feet in diameter and 50 feet long, causing
1Od4 + 10 points of damage.
lts material component is a crystal or
glass cone of very small size.

Conjure Elemental
(Conjuration/Summoning)
Range: 60 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 1 tum
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
There are actually four spells in the con-
jure elemental spell. The wizard is able to
conjure an air, earth, fire, or water elemen-
tal with this spell—assuming he has the
material component for the particular ele-
mental. (A considerable fire source must be
in range to conjure a fire elemental; a large
amount of water must be available to con-
jure a water elemental.) Conjured elemen-
tals have 8 Hit Dice.
lt is possible to conjure up successive ele-
mentals of different types if the spellcaster
has memorized two or more of these spells.
The type of elemental to be conjured must
be decided upon before memorizing the
spell. Each type of elemental can be con-
jured only once per day.
The elemental conjured up must be con-
trolled by the wizard—the spellcaster must
concentrate on the elemental doing his
commands—or it turns on the wizard and
attacks. The elemental will not break off a
combat to do so, but it will avoid u-eatures
while seeking its conjurer. If the wizard is
wounded or grappled, his concentration is
broken. There is always a 5% chance that
the elemental turns on its conjurer regard-
less of concentration. This check is made at
the end of the second and each succeeding
round. An elemental that breaks free of its
control can be dispelled by the caster, but
the chance of success is only 50%. The ele
mental can be controlled up to 30 yards
away per level of the spellcaster. The ele-
mental remains until its fonn on this plane is
destroyed due to damage or until the spell's
duration expires. Note that water elemen-
tals are destroyed if they are ever more than
60 yards from a large body of water.
The material component of the spell
(besides the quantity of the element at hand)
is a small amount of one of the following:
Air Elemental-—burn.ing incense
Earth Elemental—soft clay
Fire Elemental—sulphur and phosphonis
Water Elemental—water and sand
Special protection from uncontrolled ele-
mentals is available by means of a protec-
tion from evil spell.



Contact Other Plane (Divination)
Range: 0
Components: V
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 tu.rn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, the wizard sends
his mind to another plane of existence in
order to receive advice and information
from powers there. As these powers resent
such contact, only brief answers are given.
(The DM answers all questions with "yes,"
"no," "maybe," "never," "irrelevant," etc.)
Any questions asked are answered by the
power during the spell's duration. The char-
acter can contact an elemental plane or
some plane farther removed. For every two
levels of experience of the wizard, one ques-
tion may be asked. Contact with minds far
removed from the plane of the wizard
increases the probability of the spellcaster
going insane or dying, but the chance of the
power knowing the answer, as well as the
probability of the being telling the correct
answer, are likewise increased by moving to
distant planes. Once the outer planes are
reached, the lntelligence of the power con~
tacted determines the effects.
The random table given here is subject to
DM changes, development of extraplanar
NPC beings, and so on.
lf insanity occurs, it strikes as soon as the
first question is asked. This condition lasts
for one week for each removal of the plane
contacted (see the DMG or Manual of the
Planes), to a maximum of ten weeks. There
is a 1 % chance per plane that the wizard dies
before recovering, unless a remove curse
spell is cast upon him. A surviving wizard
:an recall the answer to the question.
On rare occasions, this divination may be
blocked by the action of certain lesser or
greater powers.

Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round/ level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 20—foot cube
Saving Throw: Special
This spell is similar to the 4th-level spell,
shadow monsters, except that the monsters
created are effectively 40% of normal hit
points. if the saving throw is made, their
damage potential is only 40% of normal
and their Armor Class is 8. The monsters
have none of the special abilities of the real
creatures, although victims may be deluded
into believing this to be so.

I67
Dlsmlssal (Abiuration)
Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.
By means of this spell, a wizard on the
Prime Material plane seeks to force or to
enable a creature from another plane of
existence to retum to its proper plane. Mag-
ic resistance, if any, is checked if this spell is
used to force a being home. lf the resistance
fails, the caster's level is compared to the
creature's level or Hit Dice. If the wizard's
level is higher. the difference is subtracted
from the creature's die roll for its saving
throw vs. spell. lf the creature's level or Hit
Dice is higher, the difference is added to the
saving throw roll.
if the creature desires to be returned to its
home plane, no saving throw is necessary (it
chooses to fail the roll).
if the spell is successful, the creature is
instantly whisked away, but the spell has a
20% chance of actually sending the subject
to a plane other than its own.
The material component is any item that
is distasteful to the subject creature.
Distance Distortion (Alteration)
Range: 10 yardsl level
Components: V, 5, M
Duration: 2 tums/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: One 10-foot cube per level
Saving Throw: None
This spell can be cast only in an area com-
pletely surrounded or enclosed by earth,
rock, sand, or similar materials. The wizard
must also cast a conjure elemental spell to
summon an earth elemental. The elemental
serves without attempting to break free
when the spellcaster announces that his
intent is to cast a distance distortion spell.
The spell places the earth elemental in the
area of effect, and the elemental then causes
the area's dimensions to be either doubled or
halved for those traveling over it (spellcast-
er's choice of which). Thusa 10' X 100' cor-
ridor could seem to be either ﬁve feet wide
and 50 feet long or 20 feet wide and 200 feet
long. When the spell duration has elapsed,
the elemental returns to its own plane.
The true nature of an area affected by dis~
tance distortion is undetectable to any crea-
ture traveling along it, but the area dimly
radiates magic, and a true seeing spell can
reveal that an earth elemental is spread
within the area.
The material needed for this spell is a
small lump of soft clay.



D0|I1|Iliﬂ0I\ (Enchantment./Charm)
Range: 10 yards/level
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 person
Saving Throw: Neg.
The domination spell enables the caster to
control the actions of any person until the
spell is ended by the subject's intelligence
(see the chum: person spell). Elves and half-
elves resist this enchantment as they do all
chnmr-type spells. When the spell is cast.
the subject must roll a saving throw vs. spell
at a penalty of -2, but Wisdom adjust-
ments apply. Failure means the wizard has
established a telepathic link with the sub-
ject's mind. lf a common language is shared,
the wizard can generally force the subject to
perform as the wizard desires, within the
limits of the subject's body structure and
Strength. Note that the caster does not re-
ceive direct sensory input from the subject.
Subjects resist this control, and those
forced to take actions against their natures
receive a new saving throw with a bonus of
+1 to +4, depending on the type of action
required. Obviously self-destnictive orders
are not carried out. Once control is estab-
lished, there is no limit to the range at which
it can be exercised, as long as the caster and
subject are on the same plane.
A protection from evil spell can prevent
the caster from exercising control or using
the telepathic link while the subject is so
warded, but it cannot prevent the establish-
ment of domination.
Dream (invocation, lllusionIPhantasm)
Reversible
Range: Touch
Components: V, 5
Duration; Special
Casting Time: 1 tum
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
The dream spell enables the caster, or a
messenger touched by the caster, to send
messages to others in the form of dreams, At
the beginning of the spell, the caster must
name the recipient or identify him by some
title that leaves no doubt as to his identity.
As the caster completes the spell, the per-
son sending the spell falls into a deep trance-
like sleep, and instantaneously projects his
mind to the recipient. The sender then en-
ters the recipient's dream and delivers the
message unless the recipient is magically
protected. If the recipient is awake, the mes-
sage sender can choose to remain in the
trance-like sleep. if the sender is disturbed
during this time, the spell is immediately
cancelled and the sender comes out of the
trance. The whereabouts and current activi-
ties of the recipient cannot be learned
through this spell.
The sender is unaware of his own sur-
roundings or the activities around him while
he is in his trance. He is totally defenseless.
both physically and mentally (i.e-. he al-
ways fails any saving throw) while in the
trance.
Once the recipient's dreams are entered,
the sender can deliver a message of any
length, which the recipient remembers per-
fectly upon waking. The communication is
one-way, the recipient cannot ask questions
or offer information. Nor can the sender
gain any information by observing the
dreams of the recipient. Once the message is
delivered, the sender's mind retums in-
stantly to his body. The duration of the spell
is the time required for the sender to enter
the recipient's dream and deliver the mes-
sage.
The reverse of this spell, nightmare, en-
ables the caster to send a hideous and unset-
tling vision to the recipient. who is allowed
a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect.
The nightmare prevents restful sleep and
causes 1d10 hit points of damage. The
nightmare leaves the recipient fatigued and
unable to regain spells for the next day, A
dispel evil spell cast upon the recipient stuns
the caster of the nightmare for one tum per
level of the cleric countering this evil send-
mg.
Extension ll (Alteration)

of 1st- through 4th-level spells by 50%.
fabricate (Enchantment, Alteration)
Range: 5 yardsl level
Components: V. 5, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: 1 cubic yd./level
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the wizard is able
to convert material of one sort into a
product that is of the same material. Thus
the spellcaster can fabricate a wooden
bridge from a clump of trees, a rope from a
patch of hemp, clothes from flax or wool,
and so forth. Magical or living things can-
not be created or altered by a fabricate spell.
The quality of items made by this spell is
commensurate with the quality of material
used as the basis for the new fabrication. lf a
I68
ells (5th Level)
mineral is worked with, the area of effect is
reduced by a factor of 27—one cubic foot
per level instead of one cubic yard.
Articles requiring a high degree of crafts-
manship (jewelry, swords, glass, crystal,
etc.) cannot be fabricated unless the wizard
otherwise has great skill in the appropriate
craft.
Casting requires one full round per cubic
yard (or foot) or material to be affected by
the spell.
false Vlslon (Divination)
Range: O
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1d4 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 30-foot radius
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, the wirard is able
to confound any attempt to scry (by means
of either a spell or a magical device) any
point within the area of effect of the spell. To
use the spell, he must be aware of the scry-
ing attempt, although knowledge of the
scryer or the scryer'e location is not neces-
sary. Upon casting the spell, the caster and
all he desires within the radius of the spell
become undetectable to the scrying. Fur-
thermore, the caster is able to send what-
ever message he desires, including vision
and sound, according to the medium of the
scrying method. To do this, the caster must
concentrate on the message he is sending.
Or\ce concentration is broken, no further
images can be sent, although the caster re-
mains undetectable for the duration of the
spell.
The material component for this spell is
the ground dust of an emerald worth at least
500 gp, which is sprinkled into the air when
the spell is cast.
Ieeblemlnd (Enchantment/Clilrll)
Range: 10 yards/level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell is used solely against people or
creatures who use magic spells. Feeblemind
causes the subject's intellect to degenerate to
that of a moronic child. The subject remains
in this state until a heal or wish spell is used
to cancel the effects. Magic-using beings are
very vulnerable to this spell, thus their sav-
ing throws suffer the following penalties:

spheres, which disappears when the spell is
cast.
Hold Monster (Enchantment/Charm)
Range; 5 yards/level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round/ level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 to 4 creatures in a
40-foot cube
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell immobilizes from one to four
creatures of any type within spell range and
in sight of the spellcaster. He can opt to hold
one, two, three, or four creatures. If three or
four are attacked, each saving throw is nor-
mal; if two are attacked, each saving throw
suffers a - 1 penalty; if only one is attacked,
the saving throw suffers a -3 penalty.
The material component for this spell is
one hard metal bar or rod for each monster
to be held. The bar or rod can be as small as
a three—penny nail.
Leomund's lamentable
lelaborment (Enchantment, Evocation)
Range: 10 yards
Components: V
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 or more creatures in a 10-
foot radius
Saving Throw: Special
This devious spell distracts the subject
creatures by drawing them into an absorb-
ing discussion on topics of interest to them.
A chain of responses occurs during the next
11 rounds, with additional saving throws as
described later. These responses are conver-
sation (rounds 1-3), possible confusion
(rounds 4-6), then either rage or lamenta-
tion (rounds 7-11). All saving throws are
affected by the creatures’ Intelligences, as
noted later. The subject creatures must be
able to understand the language in which
the spellcaster speaks.
Upon casting the spell, the wizard begins
discussion of some topic germane to the
creature or creatures to be affected. Those
making a successful saving throw vs. spell
are unaffected. Affected creatures immedi-
ately begin to converse with the spellcaster,
agreeing or disagreeing, all most politely. As
long as the spellcaster chooses, he can main-
tain the spell by conversing with the sub-
ject(s). l.f the caster is attacked or otherwise
distracted, the subject creatures do not
notice.

The wizard can leave at any time after the
casting and the subject(s) continue on as if
the caster were still present. As long as they
are not attacked, the creatures ignore all else
going on around them, spending their time
talking and arguing to the exclusion of other
activities. However, when the caster leaves.
each subject completes only the stage of the
spell that it is currently in, and then the spell
is broken.
lf the caster maintains the spell for more
than three rounds, each affected creature
can roll another saving throw vs. spell.
Those failing to save wander off in confu-
sion for 1d10 + 2 rounds, staying away
from the spellcaster. Those who make this
saving throw continue to talk and roll sav-
ing throws each round the caster continues
the spell, up through the sixth round, to
avoid the confusion effect.
If the spell is maintained for more than six
rounds, each subject must roll a successful
saving throw vs. spell to avoid going into a
rage, attacking all other subjects of the spell
with intent to kill. This rage lasts for 1d4 + 1

against the rage effect realize that they have
been deceived and collapse to the ground.

l.eomuncl's Secret Chest
(Alteration, Conjuration/Summoning)
Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 60 days
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: 1 chest of about
2’ >< Z’ X 3' size
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables a specially constructed
chest to be hidden deep within the Ethereal
plane, to be summoned using a small model
of the chest. The large chest must be excep-
tionally well-crafted and expensive, con-
structed for the caster by master craftsmen.
lf made principally of wood, it must be ebo-
ny, rosewood, sandalwood. teak, or the
like, and all of its comer ﬁttings, nails, and
hardware must be platinum. lf constructed
of ivory, the metal fittings of the chest must
be gold. If the chest is fashioned from
bronze, copper, or silver, its fittings must be
electrum or silver. The cost of such a chest is
never less than 5,000 gp. Once it is con-
structed, the wizard must have a tiny replica
(Of the same materials and perfect in every
detail) made, so that the miniature of the
chest appears to be a perfect copy. One wiz-
I69
Spells (5th Level)
ard can have but one pair of these chests at
any given time—even wish spells do not
allow exceptionsl The chests themselves are
nonrnagical, and can be ﬁtted with locks,
wards, and so on just as any normal chest.
While touching the chest and holding the
tiny replica, the caster chants the spell. This
causes the large chest to vanish into the
Ethereal plane. The chest can contain one
cubic foot of material per level of the wizard
no matter what its apparent size. Living
matter makes it 75% likely that the spell
fails, so the chest is typically used for secur-
ing valuable spell books, magical items,
gems, etc. As long as the spellcaster has the
small duplicate of the magical chest, he can
recall the large one from the Ethereal plane
whenever the chest is desired. if the minia-
ture of the chest is lost or destroyed, there is
no way, not even a xbish spell, that the large
chest can retum, although an expedition
might be mounted to find it.
While the chest is in the Ethereal plane,
there is a 1% cumulative chance per week
that some being finds it. This chance is reset
to 1 % whenever the chest is recalled and the
spell recast to retum it to the Ethereal plane.
1f the chest is found, the DM must work out
the encounter and decide how the being
reacts to the chest (for example, it might
ignore the chest, fully or partially empty it,
or even exchange or add to the items
presentl).
Whenever the secret chest is brought back
to the Prime Material plane, an ethereal
window is opened and for a variable
amount of time, usually about one turn,
slowly diminishes in size. When this hole
opens between the planes, check for an ethe-
real encounter to see if a monster is drawn
through.
If the large chest is not retrieved before
the spell duration lapses, there is a cumula-
tive chance of 5% per day that the chest is
lost.
Magic jar (Necromancyl
Range: 10 yards/level
Components: V. S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special
The magic jar spell enables the caster to
shift his life force into a special receptacle (a
gem or large crystal). From there the caster
can force an exchange of life forces between
the receptacle and another creature, thus
enabling the wiurd to take over and control
the body of another creature, while the life
force of the host is confined in the recepta-
cle. The special life force receptacle must be
within spell range of the wizards body at
the time of spellcasting. The wizard's life
force shifts into the receptacle in the round



Wizard Spells (5th Level)
in which the casting is completed, allowing
no other actions.
While in the magic jar, the caster can
sense and attack any life force within a 10-
foot-per-level radius (on the same plane):
however, the exact creature types and rela-
tive physical positions cannot be deter-
mined. ln a group of life forces, the caster
can sense a difference of four or more
levels/Hit Dice and can determine whether
a life force is positive or negative energy. For
example, if two 10th-level fighters are
attacking a hill giant and four ogres, the
caster could determine that there are three
stronger and four weaker life forces within
range, all with positive life energy. The cast-
er could try to take over either a stronger or
a weaker creature, but he has no control
over exactly which creature is attacked.
An attempt to take over a host body
requires a full round. It is blocked by a pro-
tection from evil spell or similar ward. It is
successful only if the subiect fails a saving
throw vs. spell with a special modifier (see
following). The saving throw is modified by
subtracting the combined lntelligence and
Wisdom scores of the target from those of
the wizard (intelligence and hit dice in non-
human or nonhumanoid creatures). This
modifier is added to (or subtracted from)
the die roll.
Difference Die Adjustment
-9 or less + 4
-8 to -6 +3
-5 to *3 +2
3ii‘%i ii
181!-fio14:8. -1 .
+9 to + 12 ‘Z
+ 13 or more - 3
A negative score indicates that the wizard
has a lower total than the target, thus the
host has a saving throw bonus. Failure to
take over the host leaves the wizard's life
force in the magic jar.
lf successful, the casters life force occu-
pies the host body and the host's life force is
conﬁned in the magic jar receptacle. The
caster can call upon nidimentary or instinc-
tive knowledge of the subject creature, but
not upon its real or acquired knowledge
(i.e-. the wizard does not automatically
know the language or spells of the creature).
The caster retains his own attack rolls, class
knowledge and training, and any adjust-
ments due to his intelligence or Wisdom. If
the host body is human or humanoid, and
the necessary spell components are availa-
ble, the wizard can even use his memorized
spells. The host body retains its own hit
points and physical abilities and properties.
The DM decides if any additional modifica-
tions are necessary; for example, perhaps
clumsiness or inefficiency ocuirs if the cast-
er must become used to the new form. The
alignment of the host or receptacle is that of
the occupying life force.
The caster can shift freely from the host to
the receptacle if within the 10-feet/level
range. Each attempt to shift requires one
round. The spell ends when the wizard
shifts from the jar to his own body.
A successful dispel magic spell cast on the
host can drive the caster of the magic far
spell back into the receptacle and prevent
him from making any attacks for 1d4
rounds plus 1 round per level of the caster of
the dispel. The base success chance is 50%,
+/ - 5% per level difference between the
casters. A successful dispel magic cast
against the receptacle forces the occupant
back into his own body. If the wizard who
cast the magic jar is forced back into his own
body, the spell ends.
If the host body is slain, the caster retums
to the receptacle, if within range, and the
life force of the host departs (i.e., it is dead).
If the host body is slain beyond the range of
the spell, both the host and the caster die.
Any life force with nowhere to go is treat-
ed as slain unless recalled by a raise dead,
resurrection, or similar spell.
If the body of the caster is slain. his life
force survives if it is in either the receptacle
or the host. lf the receptacle is destroyed
while the casters life force occupies it, the
caster is irrevocably slain.
Major Creation (Illusion/P'hantasm)
Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
Like the minor creation spell, major crea-
tion enables the wizard to pull wisps of
material from the plane of Shadow to create
an item of nonliving, vegetable nature—soft
goods, rope, wood, etc. The wizard can also
create mineral objects—stone, crystal,
metal, etc. The item created cannot exceed
one cubic foot per level of the spellcaster in
volume. The duration of the created item
varies with its relative hardness and rarity:
Vegetable matter 2 hoursl level
$tone or Crystal 1 hour/level
Precious metals 2 tums/level
Gems 1 tum/level
Mithral ‘ 2 rounds/level
Adamantite 1 roundl level
“ includes similar rare metals.
Attempting to use any of these as material
components in a spell will cause the spell to
fail. The spellcaster must have at least a tiny
piece of matter of the same type as the item
he plans to create—a bit of twisted hemp to
create rope, a chip of stone to create a boul-
der, and so on.

Monster Summoning Ill
(Coniurationﬁummoningl
Range: 50 yards
Components: V. S, M
Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Spedal
Saving Throw: None
This spell is much like the 3rd-level mon-
ster summoning I spell, except that this spell
summons 1d4 3rd-level monsters. These
appear within spell range and attack the
caster's opponents, until either he com-
mands them to cease, the spell duration
expires, or the monsters are slain. These
creatures do not check morale and vanish
when slain. If no opponent exists to fight,
and the wizard can communicate with
them, the summoned monsters can perform
other services for the wizard.
The material components of this spell are
a tiny bag and a small candle.
Mordenkalnen's Faithful Hound
(ConiurationlSummonlng)
Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5
Area of Hfect: Special
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the wizard sum-
mons up a phantom watchdog that only he
can see. He may then command it to per-
form as guardian of a passage, room, door.
or similar space or portal. The phantom
watchdog immediately commences a loud
barking if any creature larger than a cat
approaches the place it guards. As the faith-
ful hound is able to detect invisible creatures
and ward against the approach of ethereal
creatures, it is an excellent guardian. It does
not react to illusions that are not at least
quasi—real.
If the intruding creature exposes its back
to the watchdog, the dog delivers a vicious
attack as if it were a 10-Hit Dice monster,
striking for 3d6 points of damage. lt is able
to hit opponents of all types, even those
nonnally subject only to magical weapons
of +3 or greater. Creatures without backs
are not attacked (ochre jellies, for instance).
The faithful hound cannot be attacked, but
it can be dispelled. The spell lasts for a maxi-
mum of one hour plus 1/z hour per caster
level, but once it is activated by an intruder,
it lasts only one round per caster level. If the
spellcaster is ever more than 30 yards dis-
tant from the area that the watchdog
guards, the spell ends.
The material components of this spell are
a tiny silver whistle, a piece of bone, and a
thread.



Fasswall (Alteration)
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 hour + 1 tum/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
A passwnll spell enables the spellcaster to
open a passage through wooden, plaster, or
stone walls. but not other materials. The
spellcaster and any associates can simply
walk through. The spell causes a 5' wide X
8' high X 10’ deep opening. Several of these
spells can form a continuing passage so that
very thick walls can be pierced. If dispelled,
the passwall closes away from the dispelling
caster, ejecting those in the passage.
The material component of this spell is a
pinch of sesame seeds.
Seemlng (ll.luslonlPhantasm)
Range: 10-foot radius
Components: V, S
Duration: 12 hours
Casting Time: S
Area of Effect: 1 person/Z levels
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the caster to alter the
appearance of one person for every two
levels of experience he has attained. The
change includes clothing and equipment.
The caster can make the recipients appear as
any generally man-shaped bipedal creature.
each up to one foot shorter or taller than his
normal height, and thin or fat or in
between. All those affected must resemble
the same general type of creature: human.
orc, ogre, etc. Each remains a recognizable
individual. The effect fails for an individual
if the illusion chosen by the caster cannot be
accomplished within the spell parameters
(for example, a halfling could not be made
to look like a centaur, but he might be made
to look like a short, young ogre). Unwilling
persons receive saving throws vs. spell to
avoid the effect. Affected persons resume
their normal appearances if slain. The spell
is not precise enough to duplicate the
appearance of a specific individual.
Sending (Evocatlon)
Range: Special
Components: V, 5, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 tum
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the caster can con-
tact a single creature with whom he is famil-
iar and whose name and appearance are
known. lf the creature in question is not on
the same plane of existence as the spellcast-
Wizard Spells
er, there is a base 5% chance that the send-
ing does not arrive. Local conditions on oth-
er planes may worsen this chance
considerably at the option of the DM. The
sending, if successful, can be understood
even by a creature with an Intelligence as
low as 1 (animal Intelligence).
The wizard can send a short message of 25
words or less to the recipient. Also the recip-
ient can answer in like manner immediately.
Even if the sending is received, the subject
creature is not obligated to act upon it in
any manner.
The material component for this spell
consists of two tiny cylinders, each with one
open end, connected by a short piece of fine
copper wire.
Shadow Door (llluslonIPI|antasn\)
Range: 10 yards
Components: S
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special

By means of this spell, the wizard creates
the illusion of a door. The illusion also per-
mits the wizard to appear to step through
this "door" and disappear. ln reality he has
darted aside and can ﬂee, totally invisible.

this are deluded into seeing or entering an
empty 10' X 10' room if they open the
"door." A tme seeing spell, a gem of seeing.
or similar magical means can discover the
wizard. Certain high Hit Dice monsters
might also notice the wizard (see the invisi-
bility spell), but only if making an active
attempt to do so.
Shadow Magic (lllusion1l'hantasnil
Range: $0 yards + 10 yards/level
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: S
Area of Effect: Spedal
Saving Throw: Special
The shadow magic spell enables the wiz-
ard to tap energy from the Shadow plane to
cast a quasi-real wizard evocation spell of
3rd level or less. For example. this spell can
be magic missile, fireball. lightning bolt, or
so on, and has normal effects upon crea-
tures in the area of effect if they fail their
saving throws vs. spell. Thus a creature fail-
ing to save against a shadow magic fireball
must roll another saving throw. suffering
half of the normal fireball damage if suc-
cessful and full normal fireball damage if the
saving throw is failed. lf the ﬁrst saving
throw was successful, the shadow magic
nature is detected and only 20% of the
rolled damage is received (rounding down
below fractions below .4 and rounding up
I11
fractions of .4 and above).
Stone $hiP¢ (Alteration)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 cubic foot/level
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the wizard can
form an existing piece of stone into a shape
that suits his purposes. For example, a stone
weapon can be made, a special trapdoor
fashioned, or an idol sculpted. This spell
can also enable the spellcaster to reshape a
stone door so as to escape imprisonment.
providing the volume of stone involved was
within the limits of the area of effect. While
stone coffers can be thus formed and stone
doors made, the fineness of detail is not
great. if the construction involves small
moving parts, there is a 30% chance they do
not function.
The material component of this spell is
soft clay that must be worked into roughly
the desired shape of the stone object and
then touched to the stone when the spell is
uttered.
Summon Shadow
(Coniuration/Summoning, Necromancy)
Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 10-foot cube
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, the wizard con-
iures up one shadow (see the Monstrous
Compendium) for every three levels of
experience he has attained. These monsters
are under the control of the spellcaster and
attack his enemies on command. The
shadows remain until slain, tumed, or the
spell duration expires.
The material component for this spell is a
bit of smoky quartz.
Teleklnesls (Alteration)
Range: 10 yards/level
Components: V, 5
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Neg.
By means of this spell, the wizard is able
to move objects by concentrating on mov-
ing them mentally. The spell can provide
either a gentle, sustained force or a single
short, violent thrust.
A sustained force enables the wizard to
move a weight of up to Z5 pounds a distance



up to 20 feet per round. The spell lasts two
rounds, plus one round per caster level. The
weight can be moved vertically. horizon-
tally, or both. An object moved beyond the
caster's range falls or stops. if the caster
ceases concentration for any reason. the ob-
iect falls or stops. The object can be tele-
kinetically manipulated as if with one hand.
For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a
key can be tumed, an object rotated and so
on, if the force required is within the weight
limitation. The caster might even be able to
untie simple knots, at the discretion of the
DM.
Altematively, the spell energy can be ex-
pended in a single round. The caster can
hurl one or more obiects within range, and
within a ten-foot cube, directly away from
himself at high speed, to a distance of up to
ten feet per caster level. This is subject to a
maximum weight of 25 pounds per caster
level. Damage caused by hurled objects is
decided by the DM, but cannot exceed 1
point of damage per caster level. Opponents
who fall within the weight capacity of the
spell can be hurled, but they are allowed a
saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect.
Furthermore, those able to employ as simple
a counter-measure as an enlarge spell, for
example (thus making the body weight go
over the maximum spell limit), can easily
counter the spell. The various Bigbys hand
spells also counter this spell.
Teleport (Alteration)
Range: Touch
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is used, the wizard in-
stantly transports himself, along with a cer-
tain amount of additional weight that is on
or being touched by the spellcaster. to a
well-known destination. Distance is not a
factor, but interplanar travel is not possible
by means of a teleport spell. The spellcaster
is able to teleport a maximum weight of 250
pounds, plus an additional 150 pounds for
each level of experience above the 10th (a
13th-level wizard can teleport up to 700
pounds). If the destination area is very fa-
miliar to the wizard (he has a clear mental
picture through actual proximity to and
study of the area), it is unlikely that there is
any error in arriving, although the caster
has no control over his facing upon arrival.
lesser known areas (those seen only magi-
cally or from a distance) increase the proba-
bility of error. Unfamiliar areas present
considerable peril (see table).

Teleporting high means the wizard arrives
ten feet above the ground for every 1 % he is
below the lowest "On Target" probability;
this could be as high as 320 feet if the desti-
nation area was never seen. Any low result
means the instant death of the wizard if the
area into which he teleports is solid. A wiz-
ard cannot teleport to an area of empty
space—a substantial surface must be there,
whether a wooden floor, a stone ﬂoor, natu-
ral ground, etc. Areas of strong physical or
magical energies may make teleportation
more hazardous or even impossible.

Transmute Rock to Mud (Alteration)
Reveisible
Range: 10 yards/level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: One 20-foot cube/ level
Saving Throw; None
This spell tums natural rock of any sort
into an equal volume of mud. The depth of
the mud can never exceed one-half its length
or breadth. If it is cast upon a rock, for ex-
ample, the rock affected collapses into mud.
Creatures unable to levitate, fly, or other-
wise free themselves from the mud sink at
the rate of ten feet per round and suffocate,
except for light-weight creatures that could
normally pass across such ground, Brush
thrown atop the mud can support creatures
able to climb on top of it, with the amount
of brush required subject to the DM's discre-
tion. The mud remains until a dispel magic
spell or a reverse of this spell, mud to rock,
restores its substance—but not necessarily
its form. Evaporation tums the mud to nor-
mal dirt, at the rate of 1d6 days per ten cubic
feet. The mud to rock reverse can harden
normal mud into soft stone (sandstone or
similar mineral) permanently unless magi-
cally changed.
The material components for the spell are
clay and water (or sand, lime, and water for
the reverse).

Wall of Force (Evocationl
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Up to 10-foot square/level
Saving Throw: None
A wall of force spell creates an invisible
barrier in the locale desired by the caster, up
to the spell's range. The wall of force cannot
move and is totally unaffected by most
spells, including dispel magic. But a disinte-
grate spell will immediately destroy it, as
will a rod of cancellation or a sphere of anni-
hilation. Likewise, the wall of force is not
affected by blows, missiles, cold, heat, elec-
tricity, etc. Spells and breath weapons can-
not pass through it in either direction.
although dimension door, teleport, and
similar effects can bypass the barrier.
The wizard can, if desired, form the wall
into a spherical shape with a radius up to
one foot per level or to an open hemispheri-
cal shape of 1.5-foot radius per caster level.
The wall of force must be continuous and
unbroken when formed; if its surface is bro-
ken by any object or creature, the spell fails.
The caster can end the spell on command.
The material component for this spell is a
pinch of powdered diamond worth 5,000
gp.
Wall of iron (Evocation)
Range: 5 yards/ level ‘
Components: V. 5. M
Duration: Pen-nanent
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 15 square feet/level or
special
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, the wizard causes
a vertical iron wall to spring into being. This
wall can be used to seal off a passage or
close a breach, for the wall inserts itself into
any surrounding nonliving material if its
area is sufficient to do so. The wall of iron is
‘/4 inch thick per level of experience of the
spellcaster. The wizard is able to create an
area of iron wall up to 15 square feet for
each of his experience levels, so at 12th level
a wall of iron 180 square feet in area can be
created. The wizard can double the wall‘s
area by halving its thickness.
If the caster desires. the wall can be cre-
ated vertically resting on a flat surface, so
that it can be tipped over, to fall on and
crush any creature beneath it. The wall is
50% likely to tip in either direction. This
chance can be modified by a force of not less
than 30 Strength and 400 pounds mass—
each pound over 400 or Strength point over
30 alters the chance by 1% in favor of the
stronger side. Creatures with room to ﬂee
the falling wall may do so by making suc-



cessful saving throws vs. death. Those who
fail are killed. Huge and gargantuan crea-
tures cannot be crushed by the wall.
The wall is permanent, unless success-
fully dispelled, but it is subject to all forces a
normal iron wall is subject to—rust, perfo-
ration, etc.
The material component of this spell is a
small piece of sheet iron.
Wall ol Stone (Evocntion)
Range: 5 yarclsl level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell creates a wall of granite rodc
that merges into adjoining rock surfaces. It
is typically employed to close passages, por-
tals, and breaches against opponents. The
wall of stone is ‘/4 inch thick and up to 20
square feet per level of experience of the
wizard casting the spell. Thus, a 12th-level
wizard can create a wall of stone three
indies thick and up to 240 square feet in sur-
face area (a 12-foot-wide and 20-foot-high
wall, for example, to completely close a 10'
X 16' passage). The wall created need not
be vertical nor need it rest upon any firm
foundation (see the wall of iron spell); how-
ever, it must merge with and besolidly sup-
ported by existing stone. lt can be used to
bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp.
For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet.
the wall must be arched and buttressed.
This requirement reduces the area of effect
by half. Thus, a 20th-level caster can create
a span with a surface area of 200 square feet.
The wall can be crudely shaped to allow
crenelations, battlements, and so forth by
likewise reducing the area. The stone is per-
manent unless destroyed by a dispel magic
spell or a disintegrate spell, or by nomtal
means such as breaking or chipping.
The material component is a small block
of granite.

Anti-Magic Shell (Alﬂuration)
Rang: 0
Components: V, 5
Duration: 1 tuml level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1'/level diameter sphere
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell. the wizard sur-
rounds himself with an invisible barrier that
moves with him. The area within this bar-
rier is totally impervious to all magic and
magical spell effects. thus preventing the
passage of spells or their effects. Likewise it
prevents the functioning of any magical
items or spells within its confines. The area
is also impervious to breath weapons, gaze
or voice attacks, and similar special attack
forms.
The anti-magic shell also hedges out
charmed, summoned, or conjured crea-
tures. lt cannot, however. be forced against
any creature that it would keep at bay; any
attempt to do creates a discemible pressure
against the barrier, and continued pressure
will break the spell. Normal creatures (a
normally encountered troll rather than one
conjured up, for instance) can enter the
area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore,
while a magical sword does not function
magically within the area, it is still a sword.
Note that creatures on their home plane are
normal creatures there. Thus on the elemen-
tal plane of Fire, a randomly encountered
fire elemental cannot be kept at bay by this
spell. Artifacts, relics, and creatures of
I73
demigod or higher status are unaffected by
mortal magic such as this.
Should the caster be larger than the area
enclosed by the barrier, parts of his person
may be considered exposed, at the referee's
option. A dispel magic spell does not re-
move the spell; the caster can end it upon
command.
B|gby‘s forceful Hand llivocation)
Range: 10 yards/level
Components: V, 5. M
Duration: 1 rou.nd/ level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
Bigby's forceful hand is a more powerful
version of Bigby's interposing hand. lt cre-
ates a man-sized (five feet) to gargantuan-
sized (21 feet) hand that places itself
between the spellcaster and a chosen oppo-
nent. This disembodied hand then moves to
remain between the two, regardless of what
the spellcaster does or how the opponent
tries to get around it. However, the forceful
hand also pushes on the opponent. This
force can push away a creature weighing
500 pounds or less, slow movement to 10
feet per round if the creature weighs be
tween 500 and 2,000 pounds, or slow move-
ment by 5O% if the creature weighs more
than 2,000 pounds.
A creature pushed away is pushed to the
range limit, or until pressed against an un-
yielding surface. The hand itself inﬂicts no
damage. The forceful hand has an Armor
Class of 0, has as many hit points as its
caster in full health, and vanishes when de-
stroyed. The caster can cause it to retreat (to
release a trapped opponent, for example) or
dismiss it on command.
The material component is a glove.
Chain lightning (Evocation)
Range: 40 yards + 5 yards/level
Components: V, 5. M
Duration: instantaneous
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: ‘/1
This spell creates an electrical discharge
that begins as a single stroke of lightning,
2'/z feet wide, commencing from the finger-
tips of the caster. Unlike a lightning bolt
spell, chain lightning strikes one object or
creature initially. then arcs to a series of
other objects or creatures within range, los-
ing energy with each jump.
The bolt initially inflicts 1d6 points of
damage per level of the caster, to a maxi-
mum of 12d6 (half damage if the object or
creature rolls a successful saving throw vs.
spell). After the first strike, the lightning
arcs to the next nearest object or creature.



Each jump reduces the strength of the light-
ning by 1d6. Each creature or magical object
hit receives a saving throw vs. spell. Success
on this save indicates the creature suffers
only half damage from the bolt.
The chain can strike as many times (in-
cluding the first object or creature) as the
spell caster has levels. although each crea-
ture or object can be stmck only once.
Thus. a bolt cast by a 12th-level wizard can
strike up to 12 times, causing less damage
with each strike. The bolt continues to arc
until it has struck the appropriate number of
objects or creatures, until it strikes an object
that grounds it (interconnecting iron bars of
a large Cell or cage, a large pool of liquid.
etc.), or until there are no more objects or
creatures to strike.
Direction is not a consideration when
plotting chain lightning arm. Distance is a
factor—an arc cannot exceed the spell's
range. lf the only possible arc is greater than
the spell's range, the stroke fades into noth-
ingness. Creatures immune to electrical at-
tack can be struck, even though no damage
is taken. Note that it is possible for the chain
to arc back to the caster!
The material components are a bit of fur,
a piece of amber, glass, or crystal rod, and
one silver pin for each experience level of
the caster.
Conjure Animals
(Conjuration/Summoning)
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
The conjure animals spell enables the wiz-
ard to magically create one or more mam-
mals to attack his opponents. The total Hit
Dice of the mammals cannot exceed twice
his level, if determined randomly, or his
level if a specific animal type is requested
(see the Dungeon Master's Guide). Thus, a
wizard of 12th level could randomly conjure
two mammals with 12 Hit Dice, four with 6
Hit Dice each, six with 4 Hit Dice each, eight
with 3 Hit Dice each, twelve with 2 Hit Dice
each, or 24 with 1 Hit Die each. Count every
+ 1 hit point bonus of a creature as ‘/4 of a
Hit Die, thus a creature with 4 +3 Hit Dice
equals a 43/4 Hit Dice creature. The con-
jured animal(s) remain for one round for
each level of the conjuring wizard, or until
slain. They follow the caster's verbal com-
mands. Conjured animals unfailingly attack
the wizard's opponents, but they resist being
used for any other purpose.
Contingency (Evocationl
Range: 0
Components: V. S, M
Duration: 1 day/ level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the wiurd is able
to place another spell upon his person so
that the latter spell will come into effect un-
der the conditions dictated during the cast-
ing of the contingency spell. The
contingency spell and the spell it is to bring
into effect are cast at the same time (the one-
turn casting time indicated is the total for
both castings).
The spell to be brought into effect by the
prescribed contingency must be one that af-
fects the wizard's person (feather fall, levita-
tion, fly, feign death, etc.) and is of a spell
level no higher than I/1 of the caster's experi-
ence level (rounded down), but not higher
than the 6th spell level.

Only one contingency spell can be placed
on the spellcaster at any one time; if a sec-
ond is cast. the first one (if still active) is
cancelled. The conditions needed to bring
the spell into effect must be clear, although
they can be rather general. For example, a
contingency spell cast with an airy water
spell might prescribe that any time the wiz-
ard is plunged into or otherwise engulfed in
water or similar liquid, the airy water spell
will instantly come into effect. Or a contin-
gency could bring a feather fall spell into ef-
fect any time the wizard falls more than two
feet. ln all cases. the contingency immedi-
ately brings into effect the second spell, the
latter being "cast" instantaneously when the
prescribed circumstances occur. Note
that if complicated or convoluted condi-
tions are prescribed, the whole spell com-
plex (the contingency spell and the compan-
ion magic) may fail when called upon.
The material components of this spell are
(in addition to those of the companion spell)
100 gp worth of quicksilver and an eyelash
of an ogre mage, ki-rin, or similar spell-
using creature. in addition, the spell re-
quires a statuette of the wizard carved from
elephant ivory (which is not destroyed,
though it is subject to wear and tear), which
must be carried on the person of the spell-
caster for the contingency spell to perform
its function when called upon.
Control Weather (Alteration)
Range: O

Duration: 4d6 hours
Casting Time: 1 tum
Area of Effect: 4d4 square miles
Saving Throw: None
The control weather spell enables a wiz-
ard to change the weather in the local area.
The spell affects the weather for 4d6 hours
in an area of 4d4 square miles. It requires
one tum to cast the spell, and an additional
1d4 turns for the weather conditions to oc-
cur. The current weather conditions are de-
cided by the DM. depending on the climate
and season. Weather conditions have three
components: precipitation, temperature.
and wind. The spell can change these condi-
tions according to the following chart.
The upper-cased headings represent the
existing weather conditions. The small
headings beneath each large heading are the
new conditions to which the caster can
change the existing conditions. Further-
more, the caster can control the direction of
the wind. For example. a day that is clear
and wann with moderate wind can be con-
trolled to become hazy, hot, and calm. Con-
tradictions are not possible—-fog and strong
wind, for example. Multiple control weath-

ate climatic conditions.
Death Fog (Attention. Evocation)
Range: 30 yards
Components: V. 5. M
Duration: 1d4 rounds + 1/ level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Two 10-foot cubes/level
Saving Throw: None
The casting of a death fog spell creates an
area of solid fog that has the additional
property of being highly acidic. The vapors
are deadly to living things, so that vegeta-
tion exposed to them will die-—grass and
similar small plants in two rounds, bushes
and shrubs in four. small trees in eight, and
large trees in 16 rounds. Animal life not
immune to acid suffers damage according to
the length of time it is exposed to the vapors
of a death fog, as follows:
1st round: 1 point
2nd round: 2 points
3rd round: 4 points
4th and each succeeding round: 8 points
The death fog otherwise resembles the
2nd-level fog cloud: rolling. billowing
vapors that can be moved only by a very
strong wind. Any creature attempting to
move through the death fog progresses at a
rate of but one foot per unit of normal
movement rate per round. A gust of wind
spell cannot affect it. A fireball, ﬂame
strike, or a wall of fire can burn it away in a
single round.
The material components are a pinch of
dried and powdered peas, powdered animal
hoof, and strong acid oi any sort (including
highly distilled vinegar or acid crystals).
which must be obtained from an alchemist.
Death Spell (Necromancy)
Range: 10 yards/level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: instantaneous
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: One 30-foot cube/level
Saving Throw: None
When a death spell is cast. it snuffs out the
life forces of creatures in the area of effect
instantly and irrevocably. Such creatures
cannot be raised or resurrected, but an indi-
vidual slain in this manner might be brought
back via a wish. The number of creatures
that can be slain is a function of their ‘Hit
Dice.

lf Creatures of differing Hit Dice are

(4d.20) to detennine how many creatures of

any remaining points from the 4d20 roll.
subtract 2 for each creature of 2 to 4 Hit
Dice (these creatures also die). if this still
doesn't use up all the 4d20 roll, subtract 10
for each creature of 4 + 1 to 6+3 Hit Dice.
and so on. Stop when all the creatures are
dead, all the 4dZO roll is used up, or the
remainder is less than '/z of the CF of any
remaining creatures. (lf the remainder is ‘/1
or more of the CF of a creature, that crea-
ture dies.)
Example: A mixed group of Z0 goblins,
eight gnolls. and four ogres, led by a hill
giant, are caught in the area of a death spell.
The 4d20 roll gives a total of 53 points; 20 of
this eliminates the goblins (Z0 X 1 CF). 16
kills the gnolls (8 x Z CF), and the remain-
ing 17 kills two ogres (10 points to kill one
ogre, and the remaining 7 points are enough
to kill one more ogre). The other two ogres
and the hill giant are unharmed.
A death spell does not affect lycan-
thropes. undead creatures, or creatures
from planes other than the Prime Material.
The material component of this spell is a
cnished black pearl with a minimum value
of 1.000 gp.
Dernl-Shadow Magic
(illusion/Phantasm)
Range: 60 yards '4' 10 yards/level
Components: V, 5
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special
This spell is similar to the 5th-level
shadow magic spell, but this spell enables
the casting of partially real 4th- and 5th
I15
level evocations (cone of cold, wall of fire,
wall of ice, cloudkill, etc.). if recognized as
demi-shadow magic (if a saving throw vs.
spell is successful). damaging spells inflict
only 40% of normal damage, with a mini-
mum of Z points per die of damage. A demi-
magic cloudkill slays creatures with fewer
than 2 Hit Dice and inﬂicts 1d2 points of
damage per round.
Dlsinteglate (Alteration)
Range: 5 yardsl level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: lnstantaneous
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell causes matter to vanish. lt
affects even matter (or energy) of a magical
nature, such as Bigby's forceful hand. but
not a globe of invulnerability or an anti-
magic shell. Disintegration is instantane-
ous, and its effects are permanent. Any
single creature can be affected, even
undead. Nonliving matter, up to a 10' X 10'
X 10' cube, can be obliterated by the spell.
The spell creates a thin, green ray that
causes physical material touched to glow
and vanish, leaving traces of fine dust.
Creatures that successfully save vs. spell
have avoided the ray (material items have
resisted the magic) and are not affected.
Only the first creature or obiect struck can
be affected.
The material components are a lodestone
and a pinch of dust.
Enchant an Item
(Enchantment, invocation)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: 1 item
Saving Throw: Neg.
This is a spell that must be used by a wiz-
ard planning to create a magical item. The
enchant an item spell prepares the object to
accept the magic. The item must meet the
following tests: 1) it must be in sound and
undamaged condition; 2) the item must be
the finest possible, considering its nature,
i.e., crafted of the highest quality material
and with the finest workmanship; 3) its cost
or value must reﬂect the second test, and in
most cases the item must have a raw-
materials cost in excess of 100 gp. With
respect to requirement 3, it is not possible to
apply this test to items such as ropes, leather
goods, cloth, and pottery not normally
embroidered, bejeweled, tooled, carved, or
engraved. lf such work or materials can be
added to an item without weakening or
harming its normal functions, however,



Wizard Spells (6th Level)
these are required for the item to be
enchanted.
The wizard must have access to a work-
shop or laboratory, properly equipped and
from which contaminating magic can be
screened. Any magical item not related to
the fabrication process (such as most pro-
tective devices) and within 30 feet of the
materials is a source of contaminating magic
and will spoil the process.
The item to be prepared must be touched
by the spell caster. This touching must be
constant and continual during the casting
time, which is a base 16 hours plus an addi-
tional 8d8 hours (as the wizard may never
work more than eight hours per day, and
haste or any other spells will not alter the
time required in any way, this effectively
means that casting time for this spell is two
days + 1d8 days). All work must be unin-
terrupted, and during rest periods the item
being enchanted must never be more than
one foot distant from the spellcaster, for if it
is, the whole spell is spoiled and must be
begun again. (Note that during rest periods
absolutely no other form of magic can be
performed, and the wizard must remain qui-
et and in isolation or the enchantment is
ruined.)
At the end of the spell, the caster will
know that the item is ready for the final test.
He will then pronounce the final magical
syllable, and if the item makes a saving
throw (which is exactly the same as that of
the wizard) vs. spell, the spell is completed.
The spellcaster's saving throw bonuses also
apply to the item, up to +3. A result of 1 on
the 1d20 roll always results in failure.
regardless of modifications. Once the spell
is finished, the wizard can begin to place the
desired spell upon the item. The spell he
plans to place must be cast within 24 hours
or the preparatory spell fades, and the item
must be enchanted again.
Each spell subsequently cast upon an
object bearing an enchant an item spell
requires 2d4 hours per spell level of the mag-
ic being cast. Again, during casting the item
must be touched by the wizard, and during
the rest periods it must always be within one
foot of his person. This procedure holds
true for any additional spells placed upon
the item, and each successive spell must be
begun within 24 hours of the last, even if the
prior spell failed.
No magic placed on an item is permanent
unless a permanency spell is used as a finish-
ing touch. This always runs a 5% risk of
draining I point of Constitution from the
wizard casting the spell. Also, while it is
possible to tell when the basic spell (enchant
an item) succeeds, it is not possible to tell if
successive castings actually work, for each
must make the same sort of saving throw as
the item itself made. Naturally, items that
are charged—rods, staves, wands, javelins
of lightning, ring of wishes, etc.—can never
be made permanent. Magical devices can-
not be used to enchant an item or cast magic
upon an object so prepared. but scrolls can
be used for this purpose.
The materials needed for this spell vary
according to both the nature of the item
being enchanted and the magic to be cast
upon it. For example, a cloak of displace-
ment might require the hides of one or more
displacer beasts, a sword meant to slay
dragons could require the blood and some
other part of the typelsl of dragon(s) it will
be effective against, and a ring of shooting
stars might require pieces of meteorites and
the horn of a ki-rin. These specifics, as well
as other information pertaining to this spell,
are decided by your Dungeon Master and
must be discovered or researched in play.
Ensnarement (Coniuration/Summoning)
Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 tum
Area of Effect: Spedal
Saving Throw: Neg.
Casting this spell attempts a dangerous
act: to lure a powerful creature from
another plane to a specially prepared trap,
where it will be held until it agrees to per-
form one service in retum for freedom from
the ensnarement spell. The type of creature
to be ensnared must be known and stated,
and if it has a specific, proper, or given
name. this must be used in casting the
ensnarement spell. The spell causes an
awareness of a gate-like opening on the
plane of the creature to be ensnared. A spe-
cial saving throw is then made to detennine
if the creature detects the nature of the pla-
nar opening as a trap or believes it to be a
gate. To save, the creature must roll equal to
or less than its lntelligence score on 1d20.
The score is modified by the difference
between the creature's Intelligence and that
of the spellcaster. If the creature has a higher
score, the difference is subtracted from its
dice roll to save. If the spellcaster has a high-
er score, the difference is added to the dice
roll.
lf the saving throw succeeds, the creature
ignores the spell-created opening, and the
spell fails. l.f the saving throw fails, the crea-
ture steps into the opening and is ensnared.
When so trapped, the other-planar crea-
ture can freely attack the ensnaring wizard,
unless the caster has created a warding cir-
cle. Such circles may be temporary (drawn
by hand) or permanent (inlaid or carved).
Even with such protection, the entrapped
creature may break free and wreak its
vengeance upon the spellcaster.
A hand-drawn circle has a base failure
chance of 20%, while one inlaid or carved
has a base of 10% (and that is for the first
I16
time it is used, to determine whether or not
the job was done properly). The base
chance is modified by the difference
between the wizard's combined Intelligence
and experience level and the Intelligence and
the experience level or Hit Dice of the U23-
ture ensnared. lf the spellcaster has a higher
total, that difference in percentage points is
subtracted from the chance for the creature
to break free. lf the creature has a higher
total, that difference is added to its chance
to break free.
The chance can be further reduced by
careful preparation of the circle. 1f the hand-
made circle is drawn over a longer period of
time, using specially prepared pigments
(1,000 gp value per turn spent drawing), the
chance of breaking free is reduced by 1 % for
every turn spent in preparation. This can
bring the base chance to 0%.
Similarly, an inlaid or carved design can
be brought to a 0% chance of the creature
breaking free by inlaying with various
metals, minerals, etc. This cost will require
a minimum of one full month of time and
add not less than 50,000 gp to the basic cost
of having the circle inlaid or carved into
stone. Any break in the circle spoils the effi-
cacy of the spell and enables the creature to
break free automatically. Even a straw
dropped across the line of a magic circle
destroys its power. Fortunately, the creature
within cannot so much as place a straw
upon any portion of the inscribed ward, for
the magic of the barrier absolutely prevents
it.
Once safely ensnared. the creature can be
kept for as long as the spellcaster dares.
(Remember the danger of something break-
ing the wardl) The creature cannot leave the
circle. nor can any of its attacks or powers
penetrate the barrier. The caster can offer
bribes, use promises. or make threats in
order to exact one service from the captive
creature.
The DM will then assign a value to what
the wizard has said to the ensnared creature,
rating it from O to 6 (with 6 being the most
persuasive). This rating is then subtracted
from the Intelligence score of the creature. lf
the creature rolls a successful Intelligence
check against its adjusted Intelligence, it
refuses service. New offers, bribes, etc., can
be made, or the old ones re-offered Z4 hours
later, when the creature's lntelligence has
dropped by 1 point due to confinement.
This can be repeated until the creature
promises to serve, until it breaks free, or
until the caster decides to get rid of it by
means of some riddance spell, Impossible
demands or unreasonable commands are
never agreed to.
Once the single service is completed, the
creature need only so inform the spellcaster
to be instantly sent from whence it came.
The creature might later seek revenge.



Extenslon Ill (Alteration)
Range: 0
Components: V
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell is the same as the 4th-level
extension I spell, except that it will extend
1st- through 3rd-level spells to double dura-
tion and will extend the duration of 4th- or
5th-level spells by 50% .
tyebtte (Enchantment/Clurm.
lllulion/Phantasm)
Range: 20 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round/3 levels
 Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special
An eyebite spell enables the caster to
merely meet the gaze of a creature and speak
a single word to cause an effect. This gaze
attack is in addition to any other attacks
allowed the wizard. The wizard selects one
of four possible gaze attacks at the time the
spell is cast, and this attack cannot be
changed. For example, a 12th-level caster
who chose /ear would have four opportv.mi-
ties to make gaze attacks causing fear, one
for each round of the spell's duration. Any
gaze attack is negated by a successful saving
throw vs. spell, with Wisdom adjustments.
The four effects of the spell are as follows:
Charm: The wizard can charm a single
person or monster by gaze and by uttering a
single word. The effect is to make the
charmed subject absolutely loyal and docile
to the caster, even to the point of personal
danger. lt is otherwise the same as a charm
monster spell. All creatures other than
humans, demihumans, and humanoids save
with + 2 bonuses.
Fear: The wizard can cause fear by gaze
and by speaking a single word. The subject
ﬂees in blind terror for 1d4 rounds. After
this, the creature refuses to face the caster
and cowers or bolts for the nearest cover if
subsequently confronted by the caster (50%
chance of either). The latter effect lasts one
tum per caster level. This attadt can be
negated by spells that counter fear.
Sicken: This power enables the caster to
merely gaze, speak a word, and cause sud-
den pain and fever to sweep over the sub-
ject's body. Creatures with ability scores
function at half effectiveness, others inﬂict
only one-half damage with physical attacks.
Movement is at one-half normal rate. The
subject remains stricken for one turn per
level of the caster, after which all abilities
return at the rate of one point per tum of
complete rest or one point per hour of mod-
erate activity. The effects cannot be negated
by a cure disease or heal spell, but a remove
curse or successful dispel magic spell is
effective. Creatures other than humans,
demihumans, and humanoids save with +2
bonuses versus this attack.
Sleep: The wizard can cause any individ-
ual to fall into a comatose slumber by means
of a gaze and a single word, unless the sub-
ject successfully rolls its saving throw vs.
spell. Creatures normally subiect to a 1st-
level sleep spell save with -2 penalties. An
affected creature must be shaken or other-
wise shocked back to consciousness.
In all cases, the gaze attack has a speed
factor of 1. This spell does not affect undead
of any type, or extend beyond the plane
occupied by the caster. Note that the caster
is subject to the effects of his reﬂected gaze,
and is allowed any applicable saving throw.
ln the case of a reﬂected charm gaze, the
caster is paralyzed until it wears off or is
countered.
Geas (Enchantment/Charm)
Range: 10 yards
Components: V
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
A gens spell places a magical command
upon a creature (usually human or human-
oid) to carry out some service, or to refrain
from some action or course of activity, as
desired by the spellcaster. The creature must
be intelligent, conscious, under its own voli-
tion, and able to understand the caster.
While a geas cannot compel a creature to
kill itself or to perform acts that are likely to
result in certain death, it can cause almost
any other course of action. The geased crea-
ture must follow the g‘ven instructions until
the geas is completed. Failure to do so will
cause the creature to grow sick and die with-
in 1d4 weeks. Deviation from or twisting of
the instructions causes corresponding loss
of Strength points until the deviation ceases.
A geas can be done away with by a wish
spell, but a dispel magic or remove curse
spell will not negate it. Your DM will decide
any additional details of a geas, for its cast-
ing and fulfillment are tricky, and an
improperly cast geas is ignored.

Glassee (Alteration)
Range: Touch
Components: V. S, M
Duration: 1 roundl level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell. the wizard is able
to make a section of metal, stone, or wood
as transparent as glass to his gaze, or even
make it into transparent material as
explained hereafter. Normally, up to four
inches of metal can be seen through, stone
up to six inches thick can be made transpar-
ent, and 20 inches of wood can be affected
by the glassee spell. The spell will not work
on lead, gold, or platinum. The wizard can
opt to make the glassee work only for him-
self for the duration of the Spell, or he can
actually make a transparent area, a one-
way window, in the material affected.
Either case gives a viewing area 3’ wide by 2'
high. If a window is created, it has the
strength of the original material.
The material component of the spell is a
small piece of crystal or glass.
Globe of lnvulnerahlllty (Abjuration)
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round/ level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 5-foot-radius sphere
Saving Throw: None
This spell creates an immobile, faintly
shimmering, magical sphere around the
caster that prevents any 1st-, 2nd-, 3rd-, or
4th-level spell effects from penetrating.
Thus the area of effect of any such spell does
not include the area of the globe of invulner-
ability. This includes innate spell-like abili-
ties and effects from devices. However, any
type of spell can be cast out of the magical
sphere, and these pass from the caster of the
globe to the subject without effect upon the
globe. Fifth and higher level spells are not
affected by the globe. The globe can be
brought down by a successful dispel magic
spell.
The material component of the spell is a
glass or crystal bead that shatters at the
expiration of the spell.

Alteration, Enchantment/Charm)
Range: 0
Components: V. S, M
Duration: 1 hour/level
Casting Time: 3 tums
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This special and powerful spell is primari-
ly used to defend the wizards stronghold.
The ward protects a one-storey stronghold,
with a base dimension of 400’ X 400'. The
wizard can ward a multi-storey area by
reducing the base area proportionately. The
following take place in the warded area
upon casing of the spell:
1. All corridors become misty, and visibil-
ity is reduced to 10 feet.
2. All doors are wizard locked.
3. Stairs are ﬁlled with webs from top to
bottom. These act as the Znd-level web
spell, except that they regrow within one
tum if destroyed.
4. Where there are choices in direction-
such as a cross or side passage—a minor
confusion-type spell functions so as to
make it 50% probable that intruders
believe they are going in the exact oppo-
site direction.
5. The whole area radiates magic. The nor-
mal use of the detect magi: spell becomes
impossible for those of less than the cast-
er's level and difficult for others.
6. One door per level of experience of the
wizard is covered by an illusion to
appear as if it were a plain wall.
7. The wizard can place one of the follow-
ing additional magical effects:
A. Dancing lights in four corridors
B. Magi: mouth in two places
C. Stinking cloud in two places
D. Gust of wind in one corridor or room
E. Suggestion in one place.
m
Note that items 6 and 7 function only
when the wizard is totally familiar with the
area of the spell’s effect. Dispel agic can
remove one effect, at random, per casting.
A remove curse spell will not work.
The material components of the spell are
buming incense, a small measure of sulphur
and oil, a knotted string. a small amount of
umber hulk blood, and a small silver rod.

lnvlslble Stalker
(C0njurationISummonlngl
Range: 10 yards
Components: V. S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Spedal
Saving Throw: None
This spell summons an invisible stalker
from the elemental plane of Air. This 8 Hit
Dice monster obeys and serves the spellcast-
er in performing whatever tasks are set
before it. lt is a faultless tracker within one
day of the quarry's passing. The invisible
stalker follows instructions even if they send
him hundreds or thousands of miles away
and, once given an order, follows through
unceasingly until the task is accomplished.
However, the creature is bound to serve; it
does not do so from loyalty or desire.
Therefore, it resents prolonged missions or
complex tasks, and it attempts to pervert
instnrctions accordingly. Invisible stalkers
understand common speech but speak no
language save their own.
The material components of this spell are
burning incense and a piece of horn carved
into a crescent shape.
Legend lore (Divination)
Range: 0
Components: V. S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
The legend lore spell is used to determine
legendary information regarding a known
person, place, or thing. If the person or
thing is at hand, or if the wizard is i.n the
place in question, the likelihood of the spell
producing results is far greater and the cast-
ing time is only 1d4 turns. lf only detailed
information on the person, place, or thing is
known, casting time is 1d1O days. lf only
nrmors are known, casting time is Zd6
weels.
During the casting, the wizard cannot
engage in activities other than the routine:
eating, sleeping, etc. When completed, the
divination reveals if legendary material is
available. It often reveals where this materi-
al is-—by place name, rhyme, or riddle. It
sometimes gives certain infon-nation regard-
ing the person, place, or thing (when the
obiect of the legend lore is at hand), but this
data is always in some cryptic form (rhyme,
riddle, anagram, cipher, sign, etc.).
The spell is cast with incense and strips of
ivory formed into a rectangle, but some
item of value to the caster must be sacrificed
in addition—-a potion, magical scroll, magi-
cal item, etc.
Naturally, legend lore reveals informa-
I18
tion only if the person, place, or thing is
noteworthy or legendary.
Suppose Delsenora came across an
extremely well-made sword. It radiates
magic, but when she used an identify spell.
she could not leam any information. Even
giving it to a trusted fighter didn't work as
the sword did not reveal any special
powers. Finally, she casts a legend lore spell,
hoping to gain more information. Since the
sword is at hand, she completes the spell in
three tums. l.n her mind comes the message.
"Once this was the sword of he who waits
till Albion's time of greatest peril, when
unto his hand it shall fly again. Fair was the
hand that gave me and fair was the hand
that reclaimed me." Clearly, Delsenora real-
izes, this must be a very powerful item,
since her spell gave only a u'yptic answer.
But who is he who waits’! And where is
Albion? For more information, Delsenora is
going to have to cast more spells. But now
the process will take much longer, since she
has only the vaguest of clues to follow.
Lower Water (Alteration)
Reversible
Range: 80 yards
Components; V, 5, M
Duration: 5 rotmds/level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: 10-foot square areal level.
Saving Throw: None
The wizard casting a lower water spell
causes water or similar fluid in the area of
effect to sink away. The water can be lowered
up to two feet for every experience level of
the wizard, to a minimum depth of one inch.
The water is lowered within a square area
whose sides are 10 feet long per caster level.
Thus, a 12th-level wizard affects a volume
24' X 120' X 120’, a 13th-level caster a vol-
ume of 26' X 130' X 130‘. and so on. ln
extremely large and deep bodies of water,
such as deep ooean, the spell creat a whirl-
pool that sweeps ships and similar craft
downward, putting them at risk and render-
ing them unable to leave by nonnal move-
ment for the duration of the spell. When cast
on water elernmtals and other water-based
creatures, this spell acts as a slow spell: the
creature moves at half speed and makrs half
the number of attacks each round. lt has no
effect on other ueatures.
The material component of this spell is a
small vial of dust.
lts reverse, raise water, causes water or
similar ﬂuids to return to their highest natu-
ral level: spring flood, high tide, etc. This
can make fords impassable, ﬂoat grounded
ships, and may even sweep away bridges at
the referee's option. it negates lower water
and vice versa.
The material component of the raise
water spell is a small vial of water.



Mass Suggestion
(Enchantment/Charm)
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, M
Duration: 4 turns '4‘ 4 tums/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 creature/level
Saving Throw: Neg.
The mass suggestion spell enables the wiz-
ard to inﬂuence the actions of one or more
chosen creatures in the same way as the sug-
gestion spell. Up to one creature per experi-
ence level of the caster can be inﬂuenced,
provided that all subject creatures are with-
in the 30-yard range. Undead are not subject
to this spell. The suggestion must be reason-
ably worded and understood by the crea-
tures, and must be the same for all hearing
it. Creatures successfully saving vs. spell are
unaffected. Saving throws against the spell
suffer a penalty of -1, and if a single crea-
ture is to be affected, its saving throw suf-
fers a -4 penalty. Note that a very
reasonable mass suggestion can cause the
saving throw to be made with an additional
penalty (such as -1, -Z, etc.) at the discre-
tion of your DM. A mass suggestion can
continue in effect for a considerable dura-
tion, at the DM’s discretion. Conditions that
will trigger a special action can also be speci-
fied; if the condition is not met before the
spell expires, then the action will not be per-
formed.
The material Components of this spell are
a snake's tongue and either a bit of honey-
comb or a drop of sweet oil.
Mirage Arcana
(Illusion/Pltantasm, Alteration)
Range: 10 yardsl level
Components: V, S,(M optional)
Duration: Special
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: 10 feetl level radius
Saving Throw: None
The magic of this spell is similar to that of
the vacancy spell, only this is more power-
ful and elaborate. The spell enables the cast-
er to make an area appear to be something
other than it is, a setting he has personally
seen. The spell remains as long as the caster
maintains a minimal concentration upon it.
Even after this, the spell persists for a total
of one hour plus one additional tum for
each experience level of the caster. (Note:
Minimal concentration can be maintained
during normal conversation but not while
spellcasting, in melee, or if harmed by an
attack.) lf the caster actually uses a small bit
of anything connected with the place to cre-
ate this spell, then it takes on a quasi-reality.
in its basic form, forceful contact is neces-
sary to have any hope of discovering the
magic, short of a detection device or spell.
In its more complex form, where a material
component is used, detection is pomible
only by some magical means, whether
device, item, or spell. Either form of mirage
arcana is subject to the dispel magic spell.
As with all powerful illusions, the mind
of the believer urges appropriate effects
upon the viewer's body. Under the influence
of the spell, the viewer could possibly walk
across a bed of hot coals thinking it was a
shallow stream of water that was cooling his
feet (and thus suffer no damage), dine upon
imaginary food and actually be satisfied, or
rest comfortably upon a bed of sharp
stones, thinking it a featherbed. Gravity is
not affected by the spell, however, so that
an envisioned bridge spanning a deep Cl‘l3$l!‘i
does not support the believer. Those who
witness the event see it as a sudden disap-
pearance of the individual. They do not
connect it with an illusion unless they are
otherwise aware of some magic at work.
M|5|¢id (Illusion/Phantasm)
Range: 10 yards
Component: S
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
When a mislead spell is cast by the wiz-
ard, he actually creates an illusory double at
the same time that he is cloaked by
improved invisibility magic (see the 4th-
level spell). The wizard is then free to go
elsewhere while his double seemingly moves
away. The spell enables the illusion of the
wizard to speak and gesture as if it were
real, and there are full olfactory and touch
components as well. A tme seeing spell or a
gem of seeing will reveal the illusion for
what it is. A detect invisibility or true seeing
spell, or items such as a gem of seeing or
robe of eyes can detect the invisible wizard
(see the 5th-level wizard spell, shadow
door).
Monster Summoning IV
(Con]urationlSuounontng)
Range: 60 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 5 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell is much like the 3rd-level mon-
stersummoning I spell, except that this spell
summons 1d3 4th-level monsters. These
appear within spell range and attack the
caster's opponents, until he commands them
to cease, the spell duration expires, or the
monsters are slain. These creatures do not
I19
check morale; they vanish when slain. if no
opponent exists to fight, summoned mon-
sters can, if the wizard can communicate
with them, and if they are physically capa-
ble, perform other services for the summon-
ing wizard.
The material components of this spell are
a tiny bag and a small (not necessarily lit)
candle.
Niordenkainen's Lucubratlon
(Alteration)
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: lnstantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
By use of this spell, the wizard is able to
instantly recall any 1st- through 5th-level
spell he has used during the past Z4 hours.
The spell must have been memorized and
actually used during that time period. Mor-
denkainen 's lucubmtion allows the recovery
of only one spell. If the recalled spell
requires material components, these must
be provided by the caster; the recovered
spell is not usable until the material compo-
nents are available.
M°"¢ 547"‘ (Alteration)
Range: 10 yards! level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
When cast, the move earth spell moves
dirt (clay, loam, sand) and its other compo-
nents. Thus embankments can be collapsed,
hillocks moved. dunes shifted, etc. How-
ever, in no event can rock prominence: be
collapsed or moved. The area to be affected
dictates the casting time; for every 40 yd. X
40 yd. surface area and 10 feet of depth, one
turn of casting time is required. The maxi-
mum area that can be affected is 240 yd. ><
240 yd., which takes four hours. if terrain
features are to be moved—as compared to
simply caving in banks or walls of earth—it
is necessary that an earth elemental be sub-
sequently summoned to assist. All spell
casting or summoning must be completed
before any effects occur. As any summoned
earth elemental will perform most of its
work underground, it is unlikely that it will
be intercepted or interrupted. Should this
occur, however, the movement of the earth
requiring its services must be stopped until
the elemental is once again available.
Should the elemental be slain or dismissed.
the move earth spell is limited to collapsing
banks or walls of earth.



The spell cannot be used for tunneling,
and is generally too slow to trap or bury
creatures; its primary use is for digging or
filling moats or for adjusting terrain con-
tours before a battle.
The material components for this spell are
a mixture of soils (clay, loam, sand) in a
small bag and an iron blade.
Note: This spell does not violently break
the surface of the ground. lnstead it creates
wave-like crests and troughs, with the earth
reacting with glacier-like ﬂuidity until the
desired result is achieved. Trees, structures,
rock formations, and so on, are relatively
unaffected, save for changes in elevation
and relative topography.
0tllulte's Freezing Sphere
(Alteration, Evocation)
Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Spedal
Cast-ing Time: 6
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special
Otr'luke's Freezing Sphere is a multi-
purpose spell of considerable power. If the
caster opts, he may create any of the follow-
ing:
A) Frigid globe. A small globe of matter at
absolute zero temperature that spreads
upon contact with water, or a liquid that is
principally water. freezing it to a depth of
six inches over an area equal to 100 square
feet per level of the mage casting the spell.
This ice lasts for one round per level of the
caster.
The material component is a thin sheet of
crystal about an inch square.
B) Cold ray. The spell can also be used as a
thin ray of cold that springs from the caster's
hand to a distance of 10 yards per level of
the wizard; this ray inﬂicts 1d4 +2 points of
damage per level of the caster upon the first
creature struck. A saving throw vs. spell is
applicable; all damage is negated if it is suc-
cessful (as the ray is so narrow a save indi-
cates it missed). lf the first creature is
missed, the path of the ray is plotted to its
full distance, and anything else in its path
must save (if applicable) or suffer appropri-
ate damage.
The material component is a white sap-
phire of not less than 1,000 gp value.
C) Globe of cold. This creates a small globe
about the size of a sling stone, cool to the
touch, but not harmful. This globe can be
hurled, either by hand to a distance of 40
yards (considered short range), or as a sling
bullet. The globe shatters upon impact,
inflicting odo points of cold damage upon
all creatures within a 10-foot radius (one-
half damage if a saving throw vs. spell is
successful). Use the Dungeon Masters
Guide Grenade-Like Missile Table to find
where misses strike. Note that if the globe is
not thrown or slung within one round per
level of the spell-caster, it shatters and
causes cold damage as stated above. This
timed effect can be employed against pursu-
ers, although it can prove hazardous to the
spellcaster and his associates as well.
The material component is a 1,000-gp
diamond.
Part Water (Alteration)
Range: 10 yards/level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: S roundsl level
Casting Time: 1 tum
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
By employing a part water spell, the wiz-
ard is able to cause water or similar liquid to
move apart, thus forming a 20-foot-wide
trough. The depth and length of the trough
are dependent upon the level of the wizard,
and a trough three feet deep by 10 yards
long is created per level. For example, at
12th level the wizard would part water 36
feet deep by 20 feet wide by 120 yards long.
The trough remains as long as the spell lasts
or until the wizard who cast it opts to end its
effects. If cast underwater, this spell creates
an air cylinder of appropriate length and
diameter. If cast directly on a water elemen-
tal or other water-based aeature, the crea-
ture receives 4d8 damage and must roll a
successful saving throw vs. spell or ﬂee in
panic for 3d4 rounds.
The material components for the spell are
two small sheets of crystal or glass.
Permanent llluslon (Illusion/Phantum)
Range: 10 yards/level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 20' cube + 10' cube/ level
Saving Throw: Special
When this spell is cast, the wizard creates
an illusion with visual, auditory, olfactory,
and thermal elements. The spell can create
the illusion of any object, creature, or force,
as long as it is within the boundaries of the
spell's area of effect. lt affects all creatures
that view the illusion, even to the extent of
them suffering damage from falling into an
illusory pit full of sharp spikes.
Creatures that attempt to disbelieve the
illusion gain a saving throw vs. spell and, if
successful, they see it for what it is and add
+4 bonuses to associates’ saving throws, if
this knowledge can be communicated effec-
tively. Creatures not sensing the spell effect
are immune until they become aware of it.
The permanent illusion is subject to a dispel
ells (6th Level)
magic spell, of course.
The material component of the spell is a
bit of ﬂeece.
Programmed Illusion
(Illusion/Phantom)
Range: 10 yardsl level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 20' cube + 10' cube/level
Saving Throw: Special
This spell creates a spectral force spell
that activates upon command or when a
speciﬁc condition occurs. The illusion has
visual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal ele
ments. lt can be of any object, creature, or
force, as long as it remains within the
boundaries of the spell's area of effect.
The occurrence that begins the illusion
can be as general or as specific and detailed
as desired, such as the following: "Begin
only when a venerable female human carry-
ing a sack of groat clusters sits cross-legged
within one foot of this spot." Such visual
triggers can react to a character using the
disguise ability. Command range is five
yards per level of the wizard, so a 12th-level
mage can command the programmed illu-
sion to occur at a maximum encounter
range of 60 yards. A programmed illusion
cannot distinguish invisible creatures, nor
alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class, except
by extemal garb. lf desired, the effect can be
keyed to a specific noise or spoken word.
The spell lasts until the illusion occurs, thus
the spell duration is variable. The illusion
will last for a maximum of one round per
level of the spellcaster.
Creatures that attempt to disbelieve the
illusion gain a saving throw vs. spell and, if
successful, they see it for what it is and add
+4 bonuses to associates’ saving throws, if
this knowledge can be communicated effec-
tively. Creatures not sensing the spell effect
are immune until they become aware of it.
The illusion is subject to a dispel magic
spell.
The material component of the spell is a
bit of fleece.
Project Image
(Alteration, llliuionlﬂtantasm)
Range: 10 yardsl level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round/ level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the wizard creates
a nonmaterial duplicate of himself, project-
ing it to any spot within spell range, This
image performs actions decided by the



wiz.ard—walking, speaking, spellcasting—
conforming to the actual actions of the wiz-
ard unless he concentrates on making it act
differently (in which case the wizard is lim-
ited to half movement and no attacks).
The image can be dispelled only by means
of a successful dispel magic spell (or upon
command from the spellcaster); attacks pass
harmlessly through it. The image must be
within view of the wizard projecting it at all
times, and if his sight is obstructed, the spell
is broken. Note that if the wizard is invisible
at the time the spell is cast, the image is also
invisible until the caster's invisibility ends,
though the wizard must still be able to see
the image (by means of a detect invisibility
spell or other method) to maintain the spell.
if the wizard uses dimension door, teleport.
plane shift, or similar spell that breaks his
line of vision, the project image spell ends.
The material component of this spell is a
,,;pal.l replica (doll) of the wizard.
gglncarnatlon (Necromancy)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 tum
Area of Effect: Person touched
Saving Throw: None
With this spell, the wizard can bring back
to life a person who died no more than one
day per level of experience of the wizard
before the casting of the spell. The essence
of the dead person is transferred to another
body, possibly one very different from his
former body. Reincarnation does not
require any saving throw, system shock, or
resurrection survival roll. The corpse is
touched, and a new incarnation of the per-
son will appear in the area in 1d6 turns. The
person reincarnated recalls the maiority of
his former life and form, but the character
class, if any, of the new incamation might
be different indeed. The new incarnation is
determined on the following table. lf a play-
er character race is indicated, the character
must be created.

Repulslon (Abjuration)
Range: 10 yards/level
Components: V, 5, M
Duration: 1 round/2 levels
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Creatures in a
10-foot-wide path
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, the wizard is able
to cause all creatures in the path of the area
of effect to move directly away from his per-
son. Repulsion occurs at the speed of the
creature attempting to move toward the
spellcaster. The repelled creature continues
to move away for a complete round even if
this takes it beyond spell range. The caster
can designate a new direction each round,
but use of this power counts as the caster's
principal action in the round. The caster
can, of course, choose to do something else
instead of using the repulsion attack.
The material component for this spell is a
pair of small magnetized iron bars attached
to two small canine statuettes, one ivory
and one ebony.
Shades (Illusion/Phantasm)
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 20-foot cube
Saving Throw: Special
This spell is related to the shadow mori-
sters and demi-shadow monsters spells. The
shades spell uses material from the plane of
Shadow to form semi-real illusions of one or
more monsters, up to 1 Hit Die per caster
level. All shades created by one spell must
be of the same sort, and they have 60% of
the hit point total the real creatures would
have. Those viewing the shades and failing
their saving throws vs. spell believe the illu-
sion.
The shades perform as the real monsters
with respect to Annor Class and attack
forms. Special attack forms such as petriﬁ-
cation or level drain do not actually occur,
but a subject who believes the shades are
real will react appropriately, until the illu-
sion is countered by a dkpel magic spell or
the condition is countered by a heal spell.
Those who roll successful saving throws see
the shades as transparent images superim-
posed on vague shadowy forms. These are
Armor Class 6 and cause only 60% of the
true monsters’ nonnal melee damage.
Stone to Flesh (Alteration)
Reversible
Range: 10 yards/level
Components: V. 5. M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special
The stone to flesh spell turns any sort of
stone into ﬂesh. lf the recipient stone object
was formerly living, this spell restores life
land goods), although the survival of the
creature is subject to the usual system shock
survival roll. Any fonnerly living creature,
regardless of size, can be thus returned to
ﬂesh. Ordinary stone can be turned to ﬂesh
in a volume of nine cubic feet per level of
experience of the spellcaster. Such ﬂesh is
inert, lacking a vital life force. unless a life
force or magical energy is available (for
example, this spell would turn a stone golem
into a ﬂesh golem, but an ordinary statue
would become a body). If ust upon stone,
the wizard can create a cylinder of fleshy
material from one to three feet in diameter
and up to 10 feet long, allowing a passage to
be made.
The material components are a pinch of
earth and a drop of blood.
The reverse, ﬂesh to stone, turns ﬂesh of
any sort to stone. All possessions on the per-
son of the creature likewise turn to stone.
The intended subject of the spell receives a
saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. lf
a statue created by this spell is subjected to
breakage or weathering, the being (if ever
retumed to his original, ﬂeshy state) will
have similar damage, deformities, etc. The
DM may allow such damage to be repaired
by various high-level clerical spells, such as
regenerate.
The material components of the spell are
lime, water, and earth.
Tenser’s Transformation
(Alteration, Evocation)
Range: O
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
Tenser's transformation is a sight guaran-
teed to astound any creature not aware of its
power, for when the wizard casts the spell,
he undergoes a startling transformation.
The size and strength of the wizard increase
to heroic proportions, so he becomes a for-
midable ﬁghting machine: the spell causes-
the caster to become a berserk fighter! The
wizards hit points double, and all damage
he sustains comes first from the magical
points gained; once these points are elimi-



nated, all subsequent damage (to his tnie hit
points) is doubled. The Armor Class of the
wizard is 4 better than that he possessed pri-
or to casing the spell (AC 10 goes to 6, AC 9
to 5, AC 8 to 4, etc.), to a maximum Armor
Class of - 10.
All attacks are as a fighter of the same
level as the wizard (i.e., the wizard uses the
combat values normally reserved for fight-
ers). The wizard can use either a dagger or a
staff when attacking. A dagger can be used
twice per round, and each successful attack
inﬂicts an additional 2 points of damage. A
staff can be used only once per round. but
with a +2 bonus to attack and damage
rolls. The wizard fights in melee in prefer-
ence to all other forms of attack, and con-
tinues attacking until all opponents are
slain, he is killed, the magic is dispelled, or
the spell duration expires.
The material component for casting this
spell is a potion of heroism (or superhero-
ism) that the wizard must consume during
the course of uttering the spell.
Ttansmute Water to Dust (Alteration)
Revelslble
Range: 60 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Pennanent
Casting Time: S
Area of Effect: One 10-foot cube/level
Saving Throw: None (special)
When this spell is cast, the subject area
instantly undergoes a change from liquid to
powdery dust. Note that if the water is
already muddy, the area of effect is doubled,
while i.f wet mud is being transmuted, the
area of effect is quadrupled. lf water
remains in contact with the transmuted
dust, the former quickly soaks the latter,
tuming the dust into silty mud, if a suffi-
cient quantity of water exists to do so, oth-
erwise soaking or dampening the dust
accordingly.
Only liquid actually in the area of effect
at the moment of spellcasting is affected.
Liquids that are only partially water are
affected only insofar as the actual water
content is concerned, except that potions
containing water are rendered useless. Liv-
ing creatures are unaffected, except for
those native to the elemental plane of Water.
Such creatures receive saving throws vs.
spell. Failure inﬂicts 1d6 points of damage
per mster level upon the subject, while suc-
cess means the creature receives but half
damage. Only one such creature can be
affected by any single casting of this spell,
regardless of the creatures size or the size of
the spells area of effect.
The reverse of the spell is simply a very
high-powered create water spell that
requires a pinch of nonnal dust as an addi-
tional material component.
I
U Wizard Spells (7th Level)
For either usage of the spell, other compo-
nents required are diamond dust of at least
500 gp value and a bit of seashell.
True Seeing (Divination)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S. M
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 60-foot light range
Saving Throw: None
When the wizard employs this spell, he
confers upon the recipient the ability to see
all things as they actually are. The spell pen-
etrates normal and magical darkness. Secret
doors become plain. The exact location of
displaced thing is obvious. Invisible things
become visible. Illusions and apparitions
are seen through. Polymorphed, changed.
or enchanted objects are apparent. (The real
form appears translucently superimposed
on the apparent form: a gold dragon poly-
morphed to human form would appear
human with a ghostly dragon looming over
the human form.) Unlike the clerical version
of this spell, the recipient cannot determine
alignment. The recipient can focus his
vision to see into the Ethereal plane or the
bordering areas of adjacent planes. The
range of vision conferred is 60 feet. True see-
ing does not penetrate solid objects: it in no
way confers X-ray vision or its equivalent.
Furthermore, the spell effects cannot be
enhanced with magic.
The spell requires an ointment for the
eyes that is made from a very rare mush-
room powder, saffron, and fat. lt costs no
less than 300 gp per use and must be aged for
1d6 months.
Vell (Illusion/Phantasm)
Range: 10 yards/level
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 tum/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Z(Hoot cubel level
Saving Throw: None
The veil spell enables the wizard to instantly
change the appearance of his surroundin§
and party or to create halludnatory terrain so
as to fool even the most clever aeamres unless
they have the true seeing spell, a gem of see-
ing, or similar magical aid. The veil can make
a sumptuous room seem a filthy den and even
tactile impressions conform to the visual illu-
sion.  a party might be made to
raernble a mixed band of brownis, pixia,
and faeries led by a treant. lf halludnatory ter-
rain is created, touch doa not cause it to van-
ish.

lanlslnnent (Abjurntion)
Range: 20 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 1 or more creatures
in a 60-foot radius
Saving Throw: Special
A banishment spell enables the caster to
force some extraplanar creature out of the
caster's home plane. The effect is instantane-
ous, and t.he subject cannot come back with-
out some special summoning or means of
egress from its own plane to the one from
which it was banished. Up to 2 Hit Dice or
levels of creature per caster level can be ban-
ished.
The caster must both name the type of
creaturets) to be sent away and give its
name and title as well, if any. ln any event,
the creature's magic resistance must be
defeated for the spell to be effective.
The material components of the spell are
substances harmful, hateful, or opposed to
the nature of the subject(s) of the spell. For
every such substance included in the cast-
ing, the subject creature(s) loses 5% from its
magic rsistance and suffers a -2 penalty to
its saving throw vs. spell. For example, if
iron, holy water, sunstone, and a sprig of
rosemary were used in casting a banishment
upon a being that hates those things , its sav-
ing throw versus the spell would be made



with a -8 penalty (four substances times
the factor of -Z). Special items, such as hair
from the tail of a ki-rin, or couatl feathers.
could also be added to bring the factor up to
-3 or - 4 per item. in contrast, a titan’s hair
or mistletoe blessed by a druid might lower
the factor to -1 with respect to the same
creature. if the subject creature successfully
rolls its saving throw vs. spell. the caster is
stung by a backlash of energy, suffers Zdo
points of damage, and is stunned for one
round.
llgby‘s Grasping Hand (Evocation)

5i8by_'s grasping hand is a superior ver-
sign of ih e 6th-level Bigby's forceful hand. lt
create: 3 man-sized (five feet) to gar-
gantuar-ﬁzed (21 feet) hand that appears
and grasps a creature designated by the
caster. l’¢83rdless of what the spellcaster
does or how the opponent tries to escape it.
The grasping hand can hold motionless a
creature or object of up to 1,000 pounds
weight, slow movement to 10 feet per round
if the creature weighs between 1,000 and
4,000 pounds, or slow movement by 50% if
the creature weighs up to 16,000 pounds.
The hand itself inﬂicts no damage. The
grasping hand has an Armor Class of 0, has
as many hit points as its caster in full health,
and vanishes when destroyed. The caster
can order it to release a trapped opponent or
can dismiss it on command.
The material component is a leather
glove.
Charm Plants (Enchantment/Charm)
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Pennanent
Casting Time: 1 tum
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Neg.
The charm plants spell enables the spell-
caster to bring under command vegetable
life forms and communicate with them.
These plants obey instructions to the best of
their ability. The spell will charm plants in a
30' X 10' area. While the spell does not en-
dow the vegetation with new abilities, it
does enable the wizard to command the
plants to use whatever they have in order to
fulfill his instructions; if the plants in the
area of effect do have special or unusual
abilities, these are used as commanded by
the wizard. For example, this spell can gen-
erally duplicate the effects of the lst-level
priest spell entangle, if the caster desires.
The saving throw applies only to intelligent
plants, and it is made with a -'4 penalty to
the die roll.
The material components of the spell are
a pinch of humus, a drop of water, and a
twig or leaf.
Control llndead (Necromancy)
Range: 60 feet
Components: V. 5, M
Duration; 3d4 rounds 4' 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1d6 undead
Saving Throw: Special
This spell enables the wizard to command
1d6 undead creatures for a short period of
time. Upon casting the spell. the wizard se-
lects one point within range of the spell.
Those undead nearest to this point are af-
fected. until either undead equal in Hit Dice
to the caster's level or six undead are af-
fected. Undead with 3 Hit Dice or less are
automatically controlled. Those of greater
Hit Dice are allowed a saving throw vs.
spell, which if successful negates the attempt
to control that creature. Regardless of the
success or failure of the saving throw, each
creature required to make a check counts to-
ward the Hit Dice limit of the spell.
Those creatures under the control of the
wizard can be commanded by the caster if
they are within hearing range. There is no
telepathic communication between the
caster and the controlled undead. There is
no language requirement either. Even if
communication is impossible, the con-
trolled undead do not attack the spellcaster.
At the end of the spell, the controlled un-
dead revert to their normal behaviors.
Those not mindless will remember the con-
trol exerted by the wizard.
The material component for this spell is a
small piece each of bone and raw meat.
Delayed Blast fireball (Evocation)
Range: 100 yards + 10 yards/level
Components: V. S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 20-foot-radius globe
Saving Throw: ‘/2
This spell createsa fireball, with a +1 bo-
nus to each of its dice of damage, which re-
leases its blast anywhere from instantly to
five rounds later, according to the command
given by the wizard. In other respects, the
spell is the same as the 3rd-level spell ﬁre-
ball.
I83
Di-awml|'s Instant Summons
(Coniuration/Summoning)
Range: Infinite + special
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 small object
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, the wizard tele-
ports some desired item from virtually any
location directly to his hand. The single ob-
ject can be no longer in any dimension than
a sword, can have no more weight than a
shield (about eight pounds), and it must be
nonliving. To prepare this spell, the wizard
must hold a gem of not less than 5,000 gp
value in his hand and utter all but the final
word of the conjuration. He then must
crush this gem and utter the final word. The
desired item is then transported instantly
into the spellcaster's right or left hand as he
desires. The item must have been previously
touched during the initial incantation and
specifically named; only that particular
item is summoned by the spell. The special
gem used to summon the item has a magi-
cally created inscription naming the item to
be summoned. The inscription is invisible
and unreadable, except by means of a rend
magic spell, to all but the wizard who Cast
the summons.
If the item is in the possession of another
creature, the spell does not work, and the
caster knows who the possessor is and
roughly where he, she, or it is located when
the summons is cast. Items can be sum-
moned from other planes of existence, but
only if such items are not in the possession
(not necessarily the physical grasp) of an-
other creature. For each level of experience
above the 14th, the wizard is able to sum-
mon a desired item from one plane farther
removed from the plane he is in at the time
the spell is cast (one plane away at 14th
level, two planes away at 15th, etc.) Thus, a
wizard of 16th level could cast the spell even
if the desired item was on the second layer of
one of the outer planes, but at 14th level the
wizard would be able to summon the item
only if it were no farther than one of the in-
ner planes, the Ethereal plane, or the Astral
plane (see Manual of the Planes). Note that
special wards or barriers, or factors that
block the teleport or plane shift spells, may
also block the operation of this spell. Ob-
iects in beomund's secret chest cannot be re-
covered by using this spell.
Note: lf the item is wizard marked, it can
be summoned from anywhere on the same
plane unless special local conditions apply.
Furthermore, the details of the location of
the item are more specific, and the item is
more easily traceable with other types of
scrying magic.



Wizard Spells (7th Level)
Duo-Dimension (Alteration)
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: The Caster
Saving Throw: None
A duo-dimersion spell causes the caster
to have only two dimensions, height and
width, but no depth. He is thus invisible
when tumed sideways. This invisibility can
be detected only by means of a true seeing
spell or similar methods. ln addition, the
duo-dimensional wizard can pass through
the thinnest of spaces as long as these have
the proper height—going through the space
between a door and its frame is a simple
matter. The wizard can perform all actions
normally. He can turn and become invisible,
move in this state, and appear again next
round and cast a spell, disappearing on the
following round.
Note that when turned, the wizard cannot
be affected by any form of attack, but when
visible, he is subject to double the amount of
damage normal for an attack form, e.g., a
dagger thrust would inflict 2d4 points of
damage if it struck a duo-dimensional wiz-
ard. Furthermore, the wizard has a portion
of his existence in the Astral plane when the
spell is in effect, and he is subject to possible
notice by creatures there. lf noticed, it is
25% probable that the wizard is pulled en-
tirely into the Astral plane by any attack
from an astral creature. Such an attack (and
any subsequent attack received on the As-
tral plane) inﬂicts normal damage.
The material components of this spell are
a flat ivory likeness of the spellcaster (which
must be of finest workmanship. gold fili-
greed, and enameled and gem-studded at an
average cost of 500 to 1,000 gp) and a strip
of parchment. As the spell is uttered, the
parchment is given a half twist and joined at
the ends. The figurine is then passed
through the parchment loop, and both dis-
appear forever.
Flnger 0| Death (Necromancy)
Range: 60 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: S
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.
The ﬁnger of death spell snuffs out the
victim's life force. If successful, the victim
can be neither raised nor resurrected. ln ad-
dition, in human subjects the spell initiates
changes to the body such that after three
days the caster can, by means of a special
ceremony costing not less than 1,000 gp plus
500 gp per body, animate the corpse as a ju-
ju zombie under the control of the caster.
The changes can be reversed before anima-
tion by a limited wish or similar spell cast di-
rectly upon the body, while a full wish
restores the subject to life.
The caster utters the finger of death spell
incantation, points his index finger at the
creature to be slain, and unless the victim
succeeds in a saving throw vs, spell, death
occurs. A creature successfully saving still
receives 2d8+‘l points of damage. lf the
subject dies of damage, no internal changes
occur and the victim can then be revived
nonnally.
Forcecage (Evocationl
Range: 10 yards per Z levels
Components: V, S 4- special
Duration: 6 turns + 1/level
Casting Time: 3-4
Area of Effect: 20-foot cube
Saving Throw: None
This powerful spell enables the caster to
bring into being a cube of force, but it is un-
like the magical item of that name in one im-
portant respect: The forcecage does not
have solid walls of force; it has altemating
bands of force with 1/2-inch gaps between.
Thus, it is tnily a cage rather than an en-
closed space with solid walls. Creatures
within the area of effect of the spell are
caught and contained unless they are able to
pass through the openings—and of course
all spells and breath weapons can pass
through the gaps in the bars of force of the
forcecage.
A creature with magic resistance has a
single attempt to pass through the walls of
the cage. If the resistance check is success-
ful, the creature escapes. If it fails, then the
creature is caged. Note that a successful
check does not destroy the cage, nor does it
enable other creatures (save familiars) to
flee with the escaping creature. The force-
cage is also unlike the solid-walled protect-
ive device, cube of force, in that it can be
gotten rid of only by means of a dispel
magic spell or by the expiration of the spell.
By means of special preparation at the
time of memorization, a forcecage spell can
be altered to a forcecube spell. The urbe cre-
ated is 10 feet on a side, and the spell then re-
sembles that of a cube of force in all respects
save that of the differences between a cast
spell and the magic of a device, including
the methods of defeating its power.
Although the actual casting of either ap-
plication of the spell requires no material
component, the study required to commit it
to memory does demand that the wizard
powder a diamond of at least 1,000 gp
value, using the diamond dust to trace the
outlines of the cage or cube he desires to cre-
ate via spellcasting at some later time. Thus,
in memorization, the diamond dust is em-
ployed and expended, for upon completion
I84
of study, the wizard must then toss the dust
into the air and it will disappear.
l.ll'n|(ed Wish (Conjurationl5u.mmoning,
Invocation/Evocation)
Range: Unlimited
Components: V
Duration: Special
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special
The limited wish is a very potent but diffi-
cult spell. lt will fulfill literally, but only
partially or for a limited duration, the utter- I
ance of the spellcaster. Thus, the actuality of
the past, present, or future might be altered
(but possibly only for the wizard unless ma
wording of the spell is most carefully stjned)
in some limited manner. The use of a li mired
wish will not substantially change majio, ,-P
alities, nor will it bring wealth or exﬂgrience
merely by asking. The spell can, fo r rxam.
ple, restore some hit points (or all ha pgin{5
for a limited duration) lost by the wizard. lt
can reduce opponent hit probabilities or
damage, increase duration of some magical
effect, cause a creature to be favorably dis-
posed to the spellcaster, mimic a spell of 7th
level or less, and so on (see the wish spell).
Greedy desires usually end in disaster for
the wisher. Casting time is based on the time
spent preparing the wording for the spell
(clever players decide what they want to say
before using the spell). Normally the casting
time is one round (most of it being taken up
by deciding what to say). Casting this spell
ages the caster one year per 100 years of reg-
ular life span.
Mass lnvlslhlllty
(Illusion/Phantasin)
Range: 10 yardsl level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This is a more extensive adaptation of the
invisibility spell for battlefield use. lt can
hide creatures in a 60 yd. X 60 yd. area; up
to 300 to 400 man-sized creatures, 30 to 40
giants, or six to eight large dragons. The ef-
fect is mobile with the unit and is broken
when the unit attacks. Individuals leaving
the unit become visible. The wizard can end
this spell upon command.
The material component of the mass in-
visibility spell are an eyelash and a bit of
gum arabic, the former encased in the latter,



Monster Summoning V
(Conjuration/Summoning)
Range: 70 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 6 rounds 4' 1 round/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell is much like the 3rd-level mon-
ster summoning I spell, except that this spell
summons 1:13 Sth-level monsters. These ap
pear within spell range and attack the cast-
er's opponents until either he commands
them to cease, the spell duration expires, or
the monsters are slain. These creatures do
not check morale, and they vanish when
slain. if no opponent exists to fight, sum-
moned monsters can, if the wizard can com-
municate with them, and if they are
physically capable, perform other services
for the summoning wizard.
The material components of this spell are
a tiny: bag and a small (not necessarily lit)
candle.
MordenkaInen's Magniﬁcent
Mansion (Alteration, Conluration)
Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 hour/ level
Casting Time: 7 rounds
Area of Effect: 300 sq. ft./level
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the wizard con-
iures up an extradimensional dwelling, en-
trance to which can be gained only at a
single point of space on the plane from
which the spell was cast. From the entry
point, those creatures observing the area see
only a faint shimmering in the air, in an area
four feet wide and eight feet high. The caster
of the spell controls entry to the mansion,
and the portal is shut and made invisible be-
hind him when he enters. He may open it
again from his own side at will. Once ob-
servers have passed beyond the entrance.
they behold a magniﬁcent foyer and numer-
ous chambers beyond. The place is fur-
nished and contains sufficient foodstuffs to
serve a nine-course banquet to as many
dozens of people as the spellcaster has levels
of experience. There is a staff of near-
transparent servants, liveried and obedient.
there to wait upon all who enter. The atmos-
phere is clean, fresh, and warm.
Since the place can be entered only
through its special portal, outside condi-
tions do not affect the mansion, nor do con-
ditions inside it pass to the plane beyond.
Rest and relaxation within the place is nor-
ma], but the food is not. lt seems excellent
and quite ﬁlling as long as one is within the
place. Once outside, however, its effects dis-
ll
Wilard Spells (7th Level) . I
appear immediately, and if those resting
have not eaten real food within a reasonable
time span, ravenous hunger strikes. Failure
to eat normal food immediately results in
the onset of fatigue or starvation penalties
as decided by the DM.
The material components of this spell are
a miniature portal carved from ivory, a
small piece of polished marble. and a tiny
silver spoon. These are utterly destroyed
when the spell is cast.
(lt is worth mentioning that this spell has
been used in conjunction with a normal por-
tal, as well as with illusion magic. There is
evidence that the design and interior of the
space created can be altered to suit the cast-
er's wishes.)
Mordenltalnen's Sword (Evocation)
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round / level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
Upon casting this spell, the wizard brings
into being a shimmering, sword-like plane
of force. The spellcaster is able to mentally
wield this weapon (to the exclusion of all ac-
tivities other than movement), causing it to
move and strike as if it were being used by a
fighter. The basic chance for Mor-
denkainen's sword to hit is the same as the
chance for a sword wielded by a fighter of
one-half the level of the spellcaster, e.g.. if
cast by a 14th-level wirard, the weapon has
the same hit probability as a sword wielded
by a 7th-level fighter. The sword has no
magical attack bonuses. but it can hit nearly
any sort of opponent, even those normally
struck only by +3 weapons or those astral,
ethereal,or out of phase. it hits any Armor
Class on a roll of 19 or 20. lt inflicts Sdﬁ
points of damage to opponents of man-size
or smaller, and 5d6 to opponents larger than
man-sized. lt lasts until the spell duration
expires, a dispel magic is used successfully
upon it, or its caster no longer desires it.
The material component is a miniature
platinum sword with a grip and pommel of
copper and zinc, which costs 500 gp to con-
struct, and which disappears after the spell's
completion.
Phase Door (Alteration)
Range: Touch
Components: V
Duration: 1 usage/2 levels
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, the wizard attunes
his body, and a section of wall is affected as
if by a passwall spell. The phase door is in-
I85
visible to all creatures save the spellcaster,
and only he can use the space or passage the
spell creates, disappearing when the phase
door is entered, and appearing when it is ex-
ited, If the caster desires, one other creature
of man size or less can be taken through the
door; this counts as two uses of the door.
The door does not pass light, sound, or spell
effects, nor can the caster see through it
without using it. Thus the spell can provide
an escape route, though certain creatures.
such as phase spiders, can follow with ease.
A gem of true seeing and similar magic will
reveal the presence of a phase door but will
not allow its use.
The phase door lasts for one usage for
every two levels of experience of the spell-
caster. lt can be dispelled only by a casting
of dispel magic from a higher level wizard,
or by several lower level wizards, casting in
concert, whose combined levels of experi-
ence are more than double that of the wiz-
ard who cast the spell (this is the only
instance in which combining dispel effects
can be done).
Rumor has it that this spell has been
adapted by a certain powerful wizard (or
wizards) to create renewable (or permanent)
portals, whidi may (or may not) be keyed
to specific individuals (henchmen) or items
(such as rings).
Power Word, Stun
(Conluration/Summoning)
Range: 5 yards/ level
Components: V
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
When a power word, stun spell is uttered,
any creature of the mage's choice is
stunned—reeling and unable to think coher-
ently or to act-—for a duration dependent on
its current hit points. Of course, the wizard
must be facing the creature. and the creature
must be within the range of five yards per
experience level of the caster. Creatures
with 1 to 30 hit points are stunned for 4d4
rounds,those with 31 to 60 hit points are
stunned for 2d4 rounds, those with 61 to 90
hit points are stunned for 1d4 rounds, and
creatures with over 90 hit points are not af-
fected. Note that if a creature is weakened
so that its hit points are below its usual max-
imum. the current number of hit points is
used.

Reverse Gravity (Alteration)
Range: S yardsl level
Components: V. S, M
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 30 feet X 30 feet
Saving Throw: None
This spell reverses gravity in the area of
effect, causing all unattached objects and
creatures within it to "fall" upward. The
reverse gravity lasts as long as the caster
desires or until the spell expires. lf some
solid object is encountered in this "fall," the
object strikes it in the same manner as it
would during a normal downward fall. At
the end of the spell duration, the affected
objects and creatures fall downward. As the
spell affects an area, objects tens, hundreds,
or even thousands of feet in the air above
the area can be affected.
The material components of this spell are
a lodestone and iron ﬁlings.
Scquester
(Illusion/Phantasm, Abiuration)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 week + 1 day/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 2-foot cube/level
Saving Throw: Special
When cast, this spell not only prevents
detection and location spells from working
to detect or locate the objects affected by the
sequester spell, it also renders the affected
object(s) invisible to any form of sight or
seeing. Thus. a sequester spell can mask a
secret door, a treasure vault, or whatever.
Of course, it does not render the subject
proof from tactile discovery or from
devices, such as a robe of eyes or a gem of
seeing. If cast upon a creature not desiring
to be affected, a normal saving throw vs.
spell is given. Living creatures (and even
undead types) affected by a sequester spell
become comatose and are effectively in a
state of suspended animation until the spell
wears off or is dispelled.
The material components of the spell are
a basilisk eyelash, gum arabic, and a dram
of whitewash.
Shadow Walk (Illusion, Enchantment)
Range: Touch
Components: V, 5
Duration: 6 turns/ level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
ln order to use the shadow walk spell, the
wizard must be in an area of heavy
shadows. The caster and any creature he
touches are then transported to the edge of
the Prime Material plane where it borders
the plane of Shadow. ln this region the wiz-
ard can move at a rate of up to seven miles
per turn, moving normally on the borders
of the plane of Shadow but much more rap-
idly relative to the Prime Material plane.
Thus rapid travel can be accomplished by
moving in the plane of Shadow and then
I86
stepping from the plane of Shadow to the
Prime Material plane. The wizard knows
where he will come out on the Prime Materi-
al plane.
The shadow walk spell can also be used to
travel to other planes that border on the
plane of Shadow, but this requires the
potentially perilous transit of the plane of
Shadow to arrive at a border with another
plane of reality. Any creatures touched by
the wizard when shadow walk is cast also
make the transition to the borders of the
plane of Shadow. They may opt to follow
the wizard, wander off into Shadowland, or
stumble back into the Prime Material plane
(50% chance for either result if they are lost
or abandoned by the wizard). Creatures
unwilling to accompany the wizard into the
plane of Shadow get a saving throw. negat-'
ing the effect if successful.
Slmulacrum (Illusion/Pluntamn)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell. the wizard is able
to create a duplicate of any creature. The
duplicate appears to be exactly the same as
the original, but there are differences: the
simulacrum has only 51% to 60% (50% 4*
1d1O%) of the hit points of the real creature,
there are personality differences. there are
areas of knowledge that the duplicate does
not have, and a detect magic spell will
instantly reveal it as a simulacrum, as will a
true seeing spell. At all times the simula-
crum remains under the absolute command
of the wizard who created it. No special tele~
pathic link exists. so command must be
exercised in some other manner. The spell
creates the fonn of the creature, but it is
only a zombie-like creation. A reincama-
tion spell must be used to give the duplicate
a vital force, and a limited wish spell must
be used to empower the duplicate with 40%
to 65% (35% + 5 to 30%) of the knowledge
and personality of the original. The level, if
any, of the simulacrum is from 20% to 50%
of that of the original creature.
The duplicate creature is formed from ice
or snow. The spell is cast over the rough
fonn and some piece of the creature to be
duplicated must be placed inside the snow
or ice. Additionally. the spell requires pow-
dered ruby.
The simulacrum has no ability to become
more powerful: it cannot increase its level or
abilities. 1f destroyed, it reverts to snow and
mels ir\to nothingtess. Damage to the simula-

Spell Turning (Abiuratlonl
Range: 0
Components: V, 5, M
Duration: Up to 3 rounds! level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
This powerful abjuration causes spells
cast against the wizard to rebound on the
original caster. This includes spells cast
from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities,
but speciﬁcally excludes the following: area
effects that are not centered directly upon
the protected wizard. spell effects delivered
by touch, and spell effects from devices such
1 wands, slaves, etc. Thus a light spell cast
tt blind the protected wizard could be
lured back upon and possibly blind the
caste, while the same spell would be unaf-
fezcteoif cast to light an area within which
the prrtected wizard is standing.
Frmnleven to ten spell levels are affected
by the turning. The exact number is secretly
rolled by the DM; the player never knows
for certain how effective the spell is.
A spell may be only partially tumed-—
divide the number of remaining levels that
can be tumed by the spell level of the incom-
ing spell to see what fraction of the effect is
tumed—-the remainder affects the caster.
For example, if an incoming fireball is cen-
tered on a wizard with one level of tuming
left. This means that 1/: of the ﬁreball af-
fects the protected wizard, ‘la affects the
caster, and each is the center of a ﬁreball ef-
fect. lf the rolled damage is 40 points, the
protected wizard receives 27 points of dam-
age and the caster suffers 13. Both (and any
creatures in the respective areas) can roll
saving throws vs. spell for half damage.
Partially tumed hold or paralysis spells will
slow those who are 50% or more affected.
lf the protected wizard and a spellcasting
attacker both have spell tuming effects op-
erating, a resonating field is created that has
the following effects:
D100
Roll
01-70
71-B0

damage
Both turning effects are rendered
non-functional for 1d4 turns
Both casters go through a rift
into the Positive Material plane
The material component for the spell is a
small silver mirror.
Wizard Spell
Statue (Alteration)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 hourl level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Special
When a statue spell is cast, the wizard or
other creature is apparently tumed to solid
stone, along with any gannents and equip-
ment worn or carried. The initial transfor-
mation from flesh to stone requires one full
round after the spell is cast. During this ini-
tial transforrnation, the creature must roll a
saving throw of 82% or less, with -1 de-
ducted from the dice roll for each point of
Constitution, so an 18 Constitution grants
certain success. Failure indicates system
shock and death. Thereafter the creature
can withstand any inspection and appear to
be a stone statue. although a fairtt magic is
detected from the stone if it is checked for.
Despite being in this condition, the petri-
fied individual can see, hear, and smell nor-
mally. Feeling is limited to those sensations
that can affect the granite-hard substance of
the individual's body—i.e., chipping is
equal to a slight wound, but breaking off
one of the statue's arms is serious damage.
The individual under the magic of a
statue spell can retum to his normal state in-
stantly, act, and then retum to the statue
state, if he so desires, as long as the spell du-
ration is in effect.
The material components of this spell are
lime. sand, and a drop of water stirred by an
iron bar, such as a nail or spike.
Teleport Wlthout Error (Alteration)
Range: Touch
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell is similar to the teleport spell.
The caster is able to transport himself, along
with the material weight noted for a teleport
spell, to any known location in his home
plane with no chance for error. The spell
also enables the caster to travel to other
planes of existence, but any such plane is, at
best, "studied carefully." This assumes that
the caster has, in fact, actually been to the
plane and carefully perused an area for an
eventual teleportntion without error spell.
The table for the telepart spell is used, with
the caster's knowledge of the area to which
transportation is desired used to determine
chance of error. (Exception: See the 9th-
level wizard spell, succor.) The caster can
do nothing else the round that he appears
from a teleport.
I81
Vanlsll (Alteration)
Range: Touch
Components: V
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 object
Saving Throw: None
When the wizard employs this spell, he
causes an object to vanish (i.e., to be tele-
ported as if by a teleport spell) if it weighs
no more than 50 pounds per caster level.
Thus a 14th-level caster can vanish, and
cause to reappear at a desired location, an
object up to 700 pounds in weight. The max-
imum volume of material that can be af-
fected is three cubic feet per level of
experience. Thus, both weight and volume
limit the spell. An object that exceeds either
limitation is unaffected and the spell fails.
lf desired, a vanished object can be placed
deep within the Ethereal plane. ln this case,
the point from which the object vanished re-
mains faintly magical until the item is re-
trieved. A successful dispel magic spell cast
on the point will bring the vanished item
back from the Ethereal plane. Note that
creatures and magical forces cannot be
made to vanish.
There is a 1 % chance that a vanished item
will be disintegrated instead. There is also a
‘l % chance that a creature from the Ethereal
plane is able to gain access to the Prime Ma-
terial plane through the vanished item’s con-
nection.
Vlslon (Divination)
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
At such time as the wizard wishes to gain
supematural guidance, he casts a vision
spell, calling upon whatever power he de-
sires aid from, and asking the question for
which a vision is to be given in answer. Two
six-sided dice are rolled. lf they total 2 to 6,
the power is annoyed and will cause the wiz-
ard, by an ultra-powerful geas or quest, to
do some service, and no questions are an-
swered. If the dice total 7 to 9, the power is
indifferent, and some minor vision, possi-
bly unrelated to the question, is given. A
score of 10 or better indicates that the vision
is granted.
The material component of the spell is the
sacrifice of something valued by the spell-
caster or by the power supplicated. The
more precious the sacrifice, the better the
chance of spell success. A very precious
item grants a bonus of + 1 on the dice, one
that is extremely precious adds +2, and a
priceless item adds +3.

The material components of this spell are
1,000 gp worth of crushed pearls and a drop
of honey.
Note that the particular type of creature
to be affected must be named specifically,
e.g., red dragons, hill giants, wererats, lam-

if this spell is cast upon an area, a 10-foot

of the caster. if an object or item is enchant-
ed, only that single thing can be enchanted;
affected creatures or characters save vs. the
spell with a -2 penalty.
Ilghy's Clenched fist (Evocation)
Range: 5 yardsl level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: B
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
The Bigbys clenched fist spell brings forth
a huge, disembodied hand that is bailed into
a fist. This magical member is under the
mental control of the spellcaster, who can
cause it to strike one opponent each round.
No concentration is required once the spell
is cast. The clenched fist never misses, but it
can only strike as directed by the caster.
Thus it car\ be fooled by invisibility or other
methods of concealment and misdirection.
The effectiveness of its blows varies from
round to round.

° The wizard adds +4 to the die rolls of

effectively.
The fist has an Armor Class of O, and is
destroyed by damage equal to the hit points

toms of the tings rest, the whole fashioned
of an alloy of copper and zinc.
Ilndlllg (Enchantment, Evocationl
Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Cating Time: Special
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special
A binding spell creates a magical rstraint
to hold a creature, usually from another
plane of existence. Extraplanar creatures
must be confined by a circular diapam;
other creatures can be physically confine-'
The duration of the spell depends upon ne
form of the binding and the level of theiliib
er(s). as well as the length of time ﬂte quell is
actually uttered. The components vary
according to the form of the spell, but they
include a continuous chanting uttuance
read from the scroll or book page giving the
spell; gestures appropriate to the form of
binding; and materials such as miniature
chains of special metal (silver for lycan-
thropes, etc.), soporific herbs of the rarest
sort, a corundum or diamond gem of great
size (1,000 gp value per Hit Die of the sub-
ject aeature), and a vellum depiction or
carved statuette of the subject to be cap-
tured.
Magic resistance applies unless the sub-
ject‘s true name is used. A saving throw is
not applicable as long as the experience level
of the caster is at least twice as great as the
Hit Dice of the subject. The caster's level can
be augmented by one~third of the levels of
each assisting wizard of 9th level or higher,
and by one level for each assistant of 4th
through Bth level. No more than six other
wizards can assist with this spell. If the cast-
er's level is less than twice the l-lit Dioe of the
subject, then the subject gains a saving
throw vs. spell, modified by the form of
binding being attempted. The various forms
of binding are these:
Chnining: The subject is confined by
restraints that generate an antipathy affect-
ing all creatures who approach the subject,
except the caster. Duration is as long as one
year per level of the caster(s). The subject of
this form of binding (as well as in the slum-
ber and bound slumber versions) remains
within the restraining barrier.
Slumber: Brings a comatose sleep upon
the subject for a duration of up to one year
per level of the caster(s).
Bound Slumber: A combination of chain-
ing and slumber that lasts for up to one
month per level of the caster(s).
Hedged Prison: The subject is transported
to or otherwise brought within a conﬁned



Wizard Spell -
area from which it cannot wander by any
means until freed. The spell remains until
the magical hedge is somehow broken.
Metamorphosis: Causes the subject to
change to some noncorporeal form, save for
its head or face. The binding is permanent
until some prescribed act frees the subject.
Minimus Containment: The subject is
shrunken to a height of one inch or even less
and held within the hedged prison of some
gem or similar object. The subject of a mini-
mus containment, metamorphosis, or
hedged prison radiates a very faint aura of
magic.
The type of binding does not modify the
saving throw for the chaining form of the
-oell. Slumber allows the subject a +1
bnus, bound slumber a +2 bonus, hedged
pmn a +3 bonus, metamorphosis a +4
bone. and minimus containment a +5
bo.»m;to the saving throw. However, if the
subject is magically weakened, the referee
can assign a -1, -Z, or even -4 penalty to
the saving throw. A successful saving throw
enables the subject to burst its bonds and do
as it pleases.
A binding spell can be renewed in the case
of the ﬁrst three fonns of the spell, for the
subject does not have the opportunity to
break the bonds. (lf anything has caused a
weakening of a chaining or slumber version.
such as attempts to contact the subject or
magically touch it. a normal saving throw
applies to the renewal of the spell.) Other-
wise, after one year, and each year thereaf-
ter, the subject gains a nomml saving throw
vs. the spell. Whenever it is successful, the
binding spell is broken and the creature is
free.
Clone (Necromancy)
Range: Touch
Components: V, 5. M
Duration; Pennanent
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell creates a duplicate of a human,
demlhuman, or humanoid creature. This
clone is in most respects the duplicate of the
individual, complete to the level of experi-
ence, memories, etc. However, the dupli-
cate really is the person, so that if the
original and a duplicate exist at the same
time, each knows of the other‘: existence;
and the original person and the clone will
each desire to do away with the other, for
such an alter-ego is unbearable to both. lf
one cannot destroy the other, one will go
insane (90% likely to be the clone) and
destroy itself, or possibly (2% chance) both
will become mad and destroy themselves.
These events nearly always occur within
one week of the dual existence. Note that
the clone is the person as he existed at the
time at which the flesh was taken, and all
subsequent knowledge, experience, etc., is
totally unknown to the clone. The clone is a
physical duplicate, and possessions of the
original are another matter entirely. A clone
takes Zd4 months to grow, and only after
that time is dual existence established.
Finally, the clone has one less Constitution
point than the body it was cloned from, and
the cloning fails if the clone would have a
Constitution of 0.
The material component of the spell is a
small piece of the ﬂesh from the person to be
duplicated.
The DM may, in addition, add other stip-
ulations to the success of a cloning effort,
requiring that some trace of life must remain
in the flesh sample, that some means of stor-
ing and preserving the sample must be
devised and maintained, etc.
Demand
(Evocation, EnchantntentICharm)
Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 tum
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special
This spell is very much like the Sth-level
wizard spell sending, allowing a brief con-
tact with a far distant creature, except that
the message can also contain a suggestion
(see 3rd-level wizard spell), which the sub-
ject will do its best to carry out if it fails its
saving throw vs. spell, with a -2 penalty.
Of course, if the message is impossible or
meaningless according to the circumstances
that exist for the subject at the time the
demand comes, the message is understood
but no saving throw is necessary and the
suggestion is ineffective.
The caster must be familiar with the crea-
ture contacted and must know its name and
appearance well. If the creature in question
is not in the same plane of existence as the
spellcaster, there is a base 5% chance that
the demand does not arrive. Local condi-
tions on other planes may worsen this
chance considerably at the option of the
DM. The demand, if received, will be
understood even if the creature has an intel-
ligence ability score as low as 1 (animal
intelligence). Creatures of demigod status
or higher can choose to come or not, as they
please.
The demand message to the creature must
be 25 words or less. including the sugges-
tion. The creature can also give a short reply
immediately.
The material components of the spell are
a pair of cylinders. each open at one end,
connected by a thin piece of copper wire and
some small part of the subject creature—a
hair, bit of nail, etc.
I89
Glassteel (Alteration)
Range: Touch
Components: V, 5. M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Object touched
Saving Throw: None
The glnssteel spell turns normal, non-
magical crystal or glass into a transparent
substance that has the tensile strength and
unbreakability of actual steel. Only a rela-
tively small volume of material can be
affected, a maximum weight of 10 pounds
per level of experience of the spellcaster, and
it must form one whole object. The Armor
Class of the substance is 1.
The material components of this spell are
a small piece of glass and a small piece of
steel.
Incendiary Cloud
(Alteration, Evocation)
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 4 rounds + 1d6 rounds
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: ‘/2
An incendiary cloud spell exactly resem-
bles the smoke effects of a pyrotechnics
spell, except that its minimum dimensions
are a cloud of 10-foot height by 20-foot
length and breadth. This dense vapor cloud
billows forth, and on the third round of its
existence it begins to ﬂame, causing 1-2
points of damage per level of the wizard
who cast it. On the fourth round it inflicts
1d4 points of damage per level of the caster.
and on the fifth round this again drops to
1-2 points of damage per level as its flames
bum out. Any successive rounds of exist-
ence are simply harmless smoke that
obscures vision within its confines. Crea-
tures within the cloud need to make only
one saving throw if it is successful, but if
they fail the first saving throw, they roll
again on the fourth and fifth rounds (if nec-
essary) to attempt to reduce damage sus-
tained by one-half.
In order to cast this spell, the wizard must
have an available fire source (just as with a
pyrotechnics spell), scrapings from beneath
a dung pile, and a pinch of dust.



Mass Charm (iinchantment/Charm)
Range: 5 yardsl level
Component: V
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Neg.
A mass charm spell affects either persons
or monsters just as a charm person spell or a
charm monster spell. The mass charm spell,
however, affects a number of creatures
whose combined levels of experience or Hit
Dice does not exceed twice the level of expe-
rience of the spellcaster. All affected dea-
tures must be within the spell range and
within a 30-foot cube. Note that the crea-
tures’ saving throws are unaffected by the
number of recipients (see the charm person
and charm monster spells), but all target
creatures are subject to a penalty of -2 on
their saving throws because of the efficiency
and power of this spell. The Wisdom bonus
against charm spells does apply.
Maze (Conjuration/Summoning)
Range: 5 yardsl level
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
An ettradirnmsional space is brought into
being upon utteranoe of a maze spell. The sub-
ject vanishes into the shifting labyrinth of

dependent upon its Intelligence. (Note: Mino-
taurs are not affected by this spell.)

Mind Blank (Abjurntion)
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 day
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
When the very powerful mind blank spell
is cast, the creature is totally protected from
all devices and spells that detect, inﬂuence,
or read emotions or thoughts. This protects
against augury, charm, command. confu-
sion, divination. empathy (all forms), ESE
fear, feeblemind, mass suggestion, phantas-
mal killer, possession, rulership. soul trap-
ping, suggestion. and telepathy. Cloaking
protection also extends to the prevention of
discovery or information gathering by crys-
tal balls or other scrying devices, clairaudi-
ence, clairuoyance, communing, contacting
other planes. or wish-related methods
(wish, limited wish). Of course, exceedingly
powerful deities can penetrate the spell's
barrier.
Monster Summoning VI
(Conjuration/Summoning)
Range: 80 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 7 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell is much like the 3rd-level mon-
ster summoning I spell, except that it sum-
mons 1d3 6th-level monsters. These appear
in 1d3 rounds within the spell range and at-
tack the caster's opponents, until either he
commands them to cease, the spell duration
expires, or the monsters are slain. These
creatures do not check morale, and they
vanish when slain. if no opponent exists to
fight, summoned monsters can, if the wiz-
ard can communicate with them, and if they
are physically capable, perform other serv-
ices for the summoning wizard.
The material components of this spell are
a tiny bag and a small (not necessarily lit)
candle.
Otilulte's Telekinetlc Sphere
(Evocation, Alteration)
Range: 20 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1-foot-diameter sphere
per level
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell is exactly the same as the 4th-
level wizard spell, Otiluke's resilient sphere,
with the addition that the creatures or ob-
jects inside the globe are just about
weightless—anything contained within it
weighs only 1/is of its non-nal weight. Any
subject weighing up to 5,000 pounds can be
telekinetically lifted in the sphere by the
caster. Range of control extends to a maxi-
mum distance of 10 yards/level after the
sphere has actually succeeded in encapsulat-
ing a subject or subjects. Note that even if
more than 5,000 pounds of weight is en-
globed. the perceived weight is but ‘/16 of
190
actual, so the orb can be rolled without ex-
ceptional effort. Because of the reduced
weight, rapid motion or falling within the
field of the sphere is relatively harmless to
the object therein, although it can be disas-
trous should the globe disappear when the
subject inside is high above a hard surface.
The caster can dismiss the effect with a
word.
ln addition to a hemispherical piece of di-
amond and a matching piece of gum arabic.
the caster must also have a pair of small bar
magnets as material components for this
spell.
0tto’s Irresistible Dance
(Enchantment/Charm)
Range: Touch
Components: V
Duration: 1d4 + 1 rounds
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
When an Otto's irresistible dance spell is
placed upon a creature, the spell causes the
recipient to begin dancing, complete with
feet shuffling and tapping. This dance
makes it impossible for the victim to do any-
thing other than caper and prance; this ca-
vorting worsens the Armor Class of the
creature by -4, makes saving throws im-
possible except on a roll of Z0, and negates
any consideration of a shield. Note that the
creature must be touched—as if melee com-
bat were taking place and the spellcaster
were striking to do damage.
Pennanency (Alteration)
Range: Special
Components: V, S
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 2 rounds
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell affects the duration of certain
other spells, making the duration penna-
nent. The personal spells upon which a per-
manency is known to be effective are as
follows:
comprehend
languages
detect evil
detect invisibility
detect magic
infravision
protection from
cantrips
protection from evil
protection from
normal missiles
read magic
tongues
unseen servant
The wizard casts the desired spell and
then follows with the permanency spell.
Each permanency spell lowers the Wizard's
Constitution by 1 point. The wizard cannot
cast these spells upon other creatures. This



application of permanency can be dispelled
only by a wizard of greater level than the
spellcaster was when he cast the spell.
in addition to personal use, the penna-
nency spell can be used to make the follow-
ing object/creature or area-effect spells
permanent:
enlarge prismatic sphere
fear stinking cloud
gust of wind wall of fire
invisibility wall of force
magic mouth web
Additionally, the following spells can be
cast upon objects or areas only and ren-
dered permanent:
alarm wall of fire
audible glamer distance distortion
dancing lights teleport
solid fog
These applications to other spells allow it
to be cast simultaneously with any of the
latter when no living creature is the target.
but the entire spell complex then can be dis-
pelled normally, and thus negated.
The permanency spell is also used in the
fabrication of magical items (see the oth-
level enchant an item spell). At the DM’s
option, permanency might become unstable
or fail after a long period, at least 1,000
years. Unstable effects might operate inter-
mittently or fail altogether.
The DM may allow other selected spells
to be made pennanent. Researching this
possible application of a spell costs as much
time and money as independently research-
ing the selected spell. lf the DM has already
determined that the application is not possi-
ble, the research automatically fails. Note
that the wizard never leams what is possi-
ble, except by the success or failure of his
research.
Polymorph Any Oblect (Alteration)

This spell changes one object or creature
into another. When used as a polymorph
other or stone to ﬂesh spell, simply treat the
spell as a more powerful version, with sav-
ing throws made with -4 penalties to the
die roll. When it is cast in order to change
other objects, the du.ration of the qaell will
depend on how radical a change it is from
the original state to its enchanted state, as
well as how different it is in size. This will be
determined by your Dungeon Master by
using the following guidelines:

Kingdom
Class
I n telligence
A change in kingdom makes the spell
work for hours or tums—i.e., hours if one
removed, turns if two removed. Other
changes likewise affect spell duration. Thus,
changing a lion to an androsphinx would be
permanent, but tuming a tumip to a purple
worm would be a change of only hours
duration; turning a tusk into an elephant
would be permanent, but turning a twig
into a sword would be a change of only sev-
eral turns duration. All polymorphed
objects radiate a strong magic, and if a dis-
pel magic spell is successfully cast upon
them, they return to their natural form.
Note that a stone to flesh, or its reverse, will
affect objects under this spell. As with other
polymorph spells, damage sustained in the
new form can result in the injury or death of
the polymorphed creature. lt is possible to
polymorph a creature into rock and grind it
to dust, causing damage. perhaps even
death. If the creature was changed to dust to
start with, more creative methods to dam-
age it would have to be applied—perhaps
using a gust of wind spell to scatter the dust
far and wide. In general, damage occurs
when the new fonn is altered through physi-
cal force, although the DM will have to
adjudicate many of these situations.
The system shock roll must be applied to
living creatures, as must the restrictions
noted regarding the polyrnorph others and
stone to ﬂesh spells. Also note that a poly-
morph effect often detracts from an item's
or creature's powers, but does not add new
powers—except possibly movement capa-
bilities not present in the old form. Thus, a
vorpal sword polymorphed into a dagger
would not retain vorpal capability. Like-
wise, valueless items cannot be made into
permanent valuable items.
The material components of this spell are
mercury, gum arabic, and smoke.

Power Word, Illnd
(Coniuration/Summorlingl
Range: 5 yards/level
Components: V
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 15-foot-radius sphere
Saving Throw: None
When a power word. blind spell is cast,
one or more creatures within the area of
effect become sightless. The spellcaster
selects one creature as the target center, and
the effect spreads outward from the center,
affecting creatures with the lowest hit point
totals first; alternatively, the spell can be
focused to affect only an individual crea-
ture. Creatures with a current hit point total
over 100 hit points are not affected and do
not count against the number of creatures
affected. The spell affects up to 100 hit
points of creatures. but the duration
depends upon how many hit points are
affected. if 25 or fewer hit points are affect-
ed, the blindness is permanent until cured. If
2.6 to 50 hit points are affected, the blindness
lasts for 1d4 + 1 turns, if 51 to 100 hit points
of creatures are affected, the spell duration
is but 1d4+1 rounds. An individual crea-
ture cannot be partially affected: if all of its
current hit points are affected, it is blinded,
otherwise, it is not. Blindness can be
removed by a cure blindness or dispel magic
spell.
Prismatic Wall
(Conluration/Summoning)
Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special
This spell enables the wizard to conjure
up a vertical, opaque wall—a shimmering.
multi-colored plane of light that gives him
protection from all fonns of attack. This
scintillating wall ﬂashes all colors of the vis-
ible spectrum. Seven ol the colors have dis-
tinct powers and purposes. Any creature
with fewer than B Hit Dice that is within 20
feet of the wall and that does not shield its
vision is blinded for Zd4 rounds by the col-
ors of the wall. The wall is immobile. The
spellcaster can pass through the wall with-
out harm, however. Each color in the wall
has a special effect. Each color can also be
negated by a specific magical effect, but the
colors must be negated in the precise order
of the spectnim. The colors and effects (on a
being trying to attack the caster) of the pris-
matic wall spell. as well as what will negate
each color, are as follows (see next page):

The wall's maximum proportions are 40
feet wide per level of experience of the caster
and 20 feet high per level of experience. A
prismatic wall spell cast to materialize in a
space occupied by a creature is dismpted
and the spell is wasted.
Screen (Divinationllllusion)
Range: O
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 hour/level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: 30-foot cube/ level
Saving Throw: Special
This spell combines several elements to
create a powerful protection from scrying
and direct observation. When the spell is
cast, the wizard dictates what will and will
not be observed in the area of effect. The il-
lusion created must be stated in general
terms. Thus the caster could specify the illu-
sion of him and another playing chess for
the duration of the spell, but he could not
have the illusionary chess players take a
break, make dinner, and then resume their
game. He could have a crossroads appear
quiet and empty even while an army is actu-
ally passing through the area. He could
specify that no one be seen (including pass-
ing strangers), that his troops be unde-
tected, or even that every fifth man or unit
should be visible. Once the conditions are
set, they cannot be changed.
Attempts to scry the area automatically
detect the image stated by the caster with no
saving throw allowed. Sight and sound are
appropriate to the illusion Ueated. A band
of men standing in a meadow could be con-
cealed as an empty meadow with birds
chirping, etc. Direct observation may allow
a saving throw (as per a normal illusion), if
there is cause to disbelieve what is seen. Cer-
tainly onlookers in the area would become
suspicious if the column of a marching anny
disappeared at one point to reappear at an-
other! Even entering the area does not can-
cel the illusion or necessarily allow a saving
throw, assuming care is taken by the hidden
beings to stay out of the way of those af-
fected by the illusion.
Serten's Spell Immunity (Abjuration)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 tum/ level
Casting Time: 1 round/recipient
Area of Effect: Creature(s) touched
Saving Throw: None
By use of this spell, the wizard is able to
confer virtual immunity to certain spells
and magical attack forms upon those he
touches. For every four levels of experience
of the wizard, one creature can be pro-
tected by the Serten's spell immunity spell,
but, if more than one is protected, the du-
ration of the protection is divided among
the protected creatures. (Example: A 16th-
level wizard can cast the spell upon one
creature and it will last 16 tums, or place it
upon two creatures for eight turns, or upon
four creatures for four turns.) The protec-
tion gives a bonus to saving throws, ac-
cording to spell type and level, as shown in
the following table.
Spell level Wizard Spell Priest Spell
1st-3rd 4' 9 ' 4' 7
4th-6th 4' 7 4* 5

The material component of this spell is a
diamond of at least 500 gp value, which
must be crushed and sprinkled over the spell
recipients. Each such creature must also
have in its possession a diamond of at least
one carat size, intact and carried on its per-
son.
Slnlt (Enchantment, Alteration)
Range: 10 yards/ level
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 1 creature or 1 object of 1 cu-
bic footl level
Saving Throw: Special
By means of this spell, a wizard can force
a creature or object into the very earth or
floor upon which it stands. When casting
the spell, the wizard must chant the spell for
the remainder of the round without inter-
mption, At that juncture, the subject Gea-
ture or object becomes rooted to the spot
I92
unless a saving throw vs. spell (for a crea-
ture) or a saving throw vs. disintegration
(for an object with magical properties) is
successful. (Note: "magical properties" in-
clude those of magical items as listed in the
Dungeon Master's Guide. those of items en-
chanted or otherwise of magical origin, and
those of items with protection-type spells or
with permanent magical properties or simi-
lar spells upon them.) ltems of a nonmagical
nature are not entitled to a saving throw.
The subject becomes of slightly greater den-
sity than the surface upon which it stands if
its saving throw was not successful.
The spellcaster now has the option of
ceasing his spell and leaving the subject as it
is, in which case the spell expires in four
turns, and the subject returns to normal. If
the caster proceeds with the spell (into the
next round), the subject begins to sink
slowly into the pound. Before any actions
are taken in the new round, the subject sinks
one-quarter of its height; after the first
group acts, another one-quarter: after the
second group acts, another: at the end of the
round, the victim is totally sunken into the
ground.
This entombment places a creature or ob-
ject into a state of suspended animation.
The cessation of time means that the subject
does not grow older. Bodily and other func-
tions virtually cease, but the subject is oth-
emise unharmed. The subject exists in
undamaged form in the surface into which it
was sunk, its upper point as far beneath the
surface as the subject has height—a six-foot-
tall victim will be six feet beneath the sur-
face, while a 60-foot-tall subject will have
its uppermost point 60 feet below ground
level. if the ground around the subject is
somehow removed, the spell is broken and
the subject returns to normal, but it does not
rise up. Such spells as dig, transmute rock to
mud, and freedom (reverse of the 9th-level
imprisonment spell) will not harm the
sunken creature or object and will often be
helpful in recovering it. if a detect magic
spell is cast over an area upon which a sink
spell was used, it reveals a faint magical
aura of undefinable nature, even if the sub-
ject is beyond detection range. lf the subject
is within range of the detection, the spell's
schools can be discovered (alteration and
enchantment).



Symbol (Coniuration/Summoning)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special
A symbol spell creates magical nines
affecting creatures that pass over, touch, or
read the runes, or pass through a portal
upon which the symbol is  Upon
casting the spell, the wizard inscribes the
symbol upon whatever surface he desires.
Likewise, the spellcaster is able to place the
symbol of his choice, using any one of the
following:
Death One or more creatures,
whose total l\it points do
not exceed 80, are slain.
All creatures are affected
and immediately fall to loud
bickering and arguing; there
is a 50% probability that
creatures of different align
ments attack each other.
The bickering lasts for 5d4
rounds, the fighting for 2d4
rounds.
This symbol creates an
attra-strong fear spell, caus-
ing all creatures to save vs.
spell with -4 penalties to
the die roll, or panic and ﬂee
as if attacked by a fen! spell.
All creatures are affected
and must tum back in dejec-
tion unless they save vs,
spell. Affected creatures
submit to the demands of
any opponent—e.g.. sur-
render, get out, etc.; the
hopelessness lasts for 3d4
turns. During this period it
is 25% probable that affect-
ed creatures take no action
during any round, and 25%
likely that those taking
action turn back or retire
from battle, as applicable.
One or more creatures
whose total hit points do
not exceed 120 become
insane and remain so, acting
as if a confusion spell had
been placed upon them,
until a heal, restoration, or
wish spell is used to remove
the madness.
All creatures are afflicted
with wraddng pains shoot-
ing through their bodies,
causing a -2 penalty to
Dexterity and a -4 penalty
to attack dice for 2d1O
tums.
Discord
Fear
Hopelessness
Insanity
Pain
All creatures under B +1 Hit
Dice immediately fall into a
catatonic slumber and can-
not be awakened fur 1d12
+ 4 turns.
One or more creatures
whose total hit points do
not exceed 160 are stunned
and reeling for 3d4 rounds,
dropping anything they are
holding.
The type of symbol cannot be recognized
without being read and thus activating its
effects.
The material components of this spell are
powdered black opal and diamond dust,
worth not less than 5,000 gp each.

Trap the Soul (Cuniui-ation/Sunmioning)
Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent until broken
Casting Time: Special 4' 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special
This spell forces the u-eature's life force
(and its material body) into a 5P'dal prison
gem enchanted by the spellcaster. The crea-
ture must be seen by the caster when the
final word is uttered.
The spell can be triggered in one of two
ways. First, the final word of the well can be
spoken when the creature is within spell
range. This allows magic resistance (if any)
and a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the
effect. If the creature's real name is spoken
as well, any magic resistance is ignored and
the saving throw vs. spell suffers a penalty
of -2. If the saving throw is successful, the
prison gem shatters.
The second method is far more insidious,
for it tricks the victim into accepting a trig-
ger obiect insaibed with the final spell
word, automatically placing the creature’:
soul into the trap. To use this method, both
the creature's true name and the trigger
word must be inscribed on the trigger item
when the gem is enchanted. A sympathy
spell can also be placed on the trigger item.
As soon as the subject creature picks up or
accepts the trigger item, its life force is auto-
matically transferred to the gem, without
the benefit of magic resistance or saving
throw.
The gem prison will hold the trapped enti-
ty indefinitely, or until the gem is broken
and the life force is released, allowing the
material body to reform. lf the creature
trapped is a powerful creature from another
plane (and this could actually mean a char-
acter trapped by some inhabitant of another
plane of existence when the character is not
on the Prime Material plane), it can be
required to perform a service immediately
upon being freed. Otherwise the creature
I93
can go free once the gem imprisoning it is
broken.
Before the actual casting of the trap the
sou! spell, the wizard must prepare the
prison, a gem of at least 1,000 gp value for
every Hit Die or level of experience pos-
sessed by the creature to be trapped (e.g., it
requires a gem of 10,000 gp value to trap a
10 Hit Die or 10th-level creature). If the gem
is not valuable enough, it shatters when the
entrapment is attempted. (Note that while
characters have no concept of level as such,
the value of the gem needed to trap an indi-
vidual can be researched. Remember that
this value can change over time as charac-
ters advance.) Creating the prison gem
requires an enchant an item spell and the
placement of a maze spell into the gem,
thereby forming the prison to contain the
life force.

I‘ Wizard Spells (9th Level)
Nlnth-level Spells
Astral Spell (Evocation)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
By means of the astral spell, a wizard can
project his astral body into the Astral plane.
leaving his physical body and material pos-
sessions behind in the Prime Material plane
(the plane in which the entire universe and
all of its parallels exist). Only magical items
can be brought into the Astral plane
(although nonmagical items could be ren-
dered temporarily magical through the use
of some spells, if the DM allows). As the
Astral plane touches upon all of the ﬁrst
levels of the outer planes, the wizard can
travel astrally to any of these outer planes as
he wills. The caster then leaves the Astral
plane, forming a body in the plane of exist-
ence he has chosen to enter. lt is also possi-
ble to travel astrally anywhere in the Prime
Material plane by means of the astral spell.
but a second body cannot be formed in the
Prime Material plane. As a general rule, a
person astrally projected can be seen only
by creatures in the Astral plane.
At all times, the astral body is connected
to the material body by a silvery cord. lf the
cord is broken, the affected person is killed,
astrally and materially, but normally only
the psychic wind can cause the cord to
break. When a second body is fon-ned in a
different plane, the silvery cord remains
invisibly attached to the new body. lf the
astral fonn is slain, the cord simply returns
to the original body where it rests in the
Prime Material plane, reviving it from its
state of suspended animation.
Although astrally projected persons are
able to function in the Astral plane, their
actions do not affect creatures not existing
in the Astral plane. The spell lasts until the
wizard desires to end it, or until it is terrni-
nated by some outside means (a dispel mag-
ic spell or destniction of the wizards body
in the Prime Material plane).
The wizard can project the astral forms of
up to seven other creatures with him by
means of the astral spell, providing the crea-
tures are linked in a circle with the wizard.
These fellow travelers are dependent upon
the wizard and can be stranded. Travel in
the Astral plane can be slow or fast accord-
ing to the Wizard's desire. The ultimate des-
tination arrived at is subject to the
conceptualization of the mage. (See the
Manual of the Planes for further informa-
tion on the Astral plane and astral projec-
tion.)
Any magical items can go into the Astral
plane, but most become temporarily non-
magical therein, or in any planes removed
from the Prime Material plane. Armor and
weapons of +3 or better might function in
other planes at the DM's option. Artifacts
and relics function anywhere. Items draw-
ing their power from a given plane are more
powerful in that plane (e.g.. a ring of ﬁre
resistance in the elemental plane of Fire or a
sword of life stealing in the Negative Mate-
rial plane).
Blgby's Crushing lland (Evoeation)
Range: 5 yards/level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round/ level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
The Bigby's crushing hand spell creates a
huge, disembodied hand similar to those of
the other Bigby's hand spells. The crushing
hand is under the mental control of the cast-
er, and he can cause it to grasp and squeeze
an opponent. No attack roll is necessary;
the hand automatically grasps and inﬂicts
constriction damage any round in which the
wizard concentrates. The damage inflicted
depends on the number of rounds it acts
upon the victim:
1st round 1d10 hit points
Znd and 3rd rounds 2d10 hit points
4th 8: beyond 4d10 hit points
The crushing hand has an Armor Class of
0, has as many hit points as its caster at full
strength, and vanishes when destroyed. The
hand is susceptible to normal combat
attacks and damaging spells, but if it is
struck by an area-effect spell, the person
held suffers the same fate as the hand (i.e., if
the hand fails its saving throw, the victim
automatically fails his). The hand is not
effective against noncorporeal or gaseous
forms. but it does prevent creatures that are
able to slip through small cracks from
escaping. lf the hand grasps an item or con-
stnrction, the appropriate saving throw
must be made as if squeezed by a Strength of
Z5.
The material components of the spell are
a glove of snake skin and the shell of an egg.
Crystalbrlttle (Alteration)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 2 cubic ft./level
Saving Throw: Special
The magic of this spell causes metal,
whether as soft as gold or as hard as ada-
mantite, to turn to a crystalline substance as
brittle and fragile as crystal. Thus a sword,
I94
metal shield, metal armor, or even an iron
golem can be changed to a delicate, glass-
like material easily shattered by any forceful
blow. Furthermore, this change is unalter-
able short of a wish spell ; a dispel magic will
not reverse the spell.
The caster must physically touch the
item—if it is an opponent or something an
opponent is using or wearing, the wizard
must get into melee and roll a successful
attack roll. Any single metal item can be
affected by the spell. Thus a suit of armor
wom by a creature can be changed to crys-
tal, but the creature's shield would not be
affected, or vice versa. All items gain a sav-
ing throw equal to their magical bonus val-
ue or protection (the DM has this
information). A +1/ +3 sword would get a
10% (average of the two pluses) chance to
save; +5 magical armor has a 25% chance
to be unaffected; an iron golem has a 15%
chance to save (for it is hit only by magical
weapons of + 3 or better quality). Artifacts
and relics constructed of metal may be
affected at the discretion of the DM (this is
highly unlikely). Affected items not imme-
diately protected are shattered and perma-
nently destroyed if struck by a normal blow
from a metal tool or any weighty weapon,
including a staff.
Energy Draln (Evocntion, Necromancy)
Range: Touch t
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
By casting this spell, the wizard opens a
channel between the plane he is in and the
Negative Material plane, the caster becom-
ing the conductor between the two planes.
As soon as he touches (equal to a hit if melee
is involved) any living creature, the victim
loses two levels (as if struck by a spectre). A
monster loses 2 Hit Dice permanently, both
for hit points and attack ability. A character
loses levels, Hit Dice, hit points, and abili-
ties permanently (until regained through
adventuring, if applicable).
The material component of this spell is
essence of spectre or vampire dust. Prepara-
tion requires mere moments, then the mate-
rial component is cast forth, and upon
touching the victim, the wizard speaks the
triggering word, causing the spell to take
effect instantly.
The spell remains effective for a single
round only. Humans or humanoids brought
below zero energy levels by this spell can be
animated as juju zombies under the control
of the caster.
The caster always has a 5% (1 in 20)
chance to be affected by the dust, losing one
point of Constitution at the same time as the



victim is drained. When the number of Con-
stitution points lost equals the caster's origi-
nal Constitution ability score. the caster
dies and becomes a shade.
Foresight (Divination)
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2d4 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell grants the caster a powerful
sixth sense in relation to himself or another.
Although cast upon himself, the wizard can
specify that he or another is the beneﬁciary
of the spell. Once the spell is cast, the wizard
receives instantaneous warnings of impend-
ing danger or harm to the object of the spell.
Thus, if he were the object of the spell, the
wizard would be warned in advance if a
thief were about to attempt to backstab
him, or if a creature were about to leap out
from an unexpected direction, or if an
attacker were specifically targeting him
with a spell or missile weapon. When the
wamings are about him personally, the wiz-
ard cannot be surprised and always knows
the direction from which any attack on him
is made. In addition, the spell gives the wiz-
ard a general idea of what action he might
take to best protect himself—- duck, jump
right, close his eyes, etc.—and gives him a
defensive bonus of 2 to his Armor Class.
When another is the object of the spell, the
wizard receives warnings about that person.
He must still communicate this to the other
to negate any surprise. Shouting a warning.
yanking the person back, even telepathical-
ly communicating through a crystal ball can
all be accomplished before the trap is
spnmg—if the wizard does not hesitate. The
object of the spell does not gain the defen-
sive bonus to his Armor Class, however.
The material component for this spell is a
hummingbirds feather.
Gate (Con)urationISumn\oning)
Range: 30 yards
Components; V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
The casting of a gate spell has two effects.
First, it causes an interdimensional connec-
tion between the plane of existence the wiz-
ard is in and the plane in which dwells a
specific being of great power, enabling the
being to merely step through the gate, or
portal, from its plane to that of the caster.
Second, the utterance of the spell attracts
the attention of the sought-after dweller in
the other plane. When casting the spell, the
Wizard Spells (9th Level) 
wizard must name the entity he desira to
use the gate and to come to the wizards aid.
There is a 100% certainty that something
steps through the gate. Unless the DM has
some facts prepared regarding the minions
serving the being called forth by the gate
spell, the being itself comes.
If the matter is triﬂing, the being might
leave, inﬂict an appropriate penalty on the
wizard, or attack the wizard; if the matter is
of middling importance, the being can take
some positive action to set matters aright,
then demand appropriate repayment; and if
the matter is urgent, it can act accordingly
and ask whatever is its wont thereafter, if
appropriate. The actions of the being that
comes through depend on many factors,
including the alignments of the wizard and
the deity, the nature of his companions, and
who or what opposes or threatens the wiz-
ard. Such beings generally avoid direct con-
flict with their equals or betters. The being
gated in will either return immediately (very
unlikely) or remain to take action. Casting
this spell ages the wizard five years.
Imprisonment (Ahiuration)
Reversible
Range: Touch
Components: V, 5
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
When an imprisonment spell is cast and
the victim is touched, the recipient is
entombed in a state of suspended animation
(see the temporal stasis spell) in a small
sphere far beneath the surface of the earth.
The victim remains there unless a reverse of
the spell. with the creature's name and back-
ground, is cast. Magical search by crystal
ball, a locate object spell, or similar means
will not reveal the fact that a creature is
imprisoned. The imprisonment spell func-
tions only if the subject creature's name and
background are known.
The reverse speU. freedom, cast upon the
spot at which a creature was entombed and
sunk into the earth, causes it to reappear at
that spot. lf the caster does not perfectly
intone the name and background of the
creature to be freed, there is a 10% chance
that 1 to 100 creatures will be freed from
imprisonment at the same time.
Note; The exact details of any creatures
freed are up to the DM. A random method
of determining this is to roll percentile dice
twice (once for imprisoned creature density
and once for a base number of creatures at
maximum density). The rolls are multiplied
and rounded to the nearest whole number.
Each released creature has a 10% chance to
be in the area of the spellcaster. lf monsters
are being generated randomly, roll 1d20 for
I95
level, with rolls of 9 + considered 9, and the
exact monsters determined by the random
encounter tables.
For example, if the initial rolls were Z2
and 60, the number of monsters released is
.22 X .60 = .1320 = 13 monsters. Since
only 10% of these will be in the immediate
vicinity of the caster, the wizard may
encounter only one or two of them.
Meteor Swarm (Evocation)
Range: 40 yards + 10 yards/level
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: ‘/2
A meteor swarm is a very powerful and
spectacular spell which is similar to the fire-
ball spell in many aspects. When it is cast.
either four spheres of two-foot diameter or
eight spheres of one-foot diameter spring
from the outstretched hand of the wizard
and streak in a straight line to the distance
demanded by the spellcaster, up to the maxi-
mum range. Any creature in the straight-
line path of these missiles receives the full
effect of the missile, or missiles, without
benefit of a saving throw. The meteor mis-
siles leave a fiery trail of sparks, and each
bursts as a fireball. The large spheres inflict
1Od4 points of damage, bursting in a dia-
mond or box pattem. Each has a 30-foot
diameter area of effect, and each sphere is 20
feet apart, along the sides of the pattem, so
that there are overlapping areas of effect,
and the center will be exposed to all four
blasts. The eight spheres have one-half the
diameter (15 feet) and one-half the damage
potential (5d4). They burst in a pattem of a
box within a diamond or vice versa, each of
the outer sides 20 feet long. Note that the
center has four areas of overlapping effect,
and there are numerous peripheral areas
that have two overlapping areas of effect. A
saving throw for each area of effect will
indicate whether full damage or half dam-
age is sustained by creatures within each
area, except as already stated with regard to
the missiles impacting.

Mordenkalnen's Dlsjunctlon
fAlterati0lL Enchantment)
Range: 0
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 30-foot radius
Saving Throw: Special
When this spell is cast, all magic and magi-
cal items within the radius of the spell, except
those on the person of or being touched by
the spellcaster, are disioined. That is, spells
being cast are separated into their individual
components (usually spoiling the effect as a
dispel magic spell does), and permanent and
enchanted items must save (vs. spell if actu-
ally cast on a creature, or vs. a dispel magic
spell otherwise) or be tumed into normal
items. Even artifacts and relics are subject to
Mordenkainen's disjunction, although there
is only a 1% chance per caster experience
level of actually affecting such powerful
items. Thus all potions, scrolls, rings, rods,
miscellaneous magical items, artifacts and
relits, arms and armor, swords, and miscella-
neous weapons within 30 feet of the spellcast-
er can possibly lose all their magical
properties when the Mordenkainens disjunc-
tion spell is cast. The caster also has a 1%
chance per level of destroying an anti-magic
shell. If the shell survives the disjunction, no
items within it are disjoined.
Note: Destroying artifacts is a dangerous
business, and 95% likely to attract the
attention of some powerful being who has
an interest or connection with the device.
Additionally, if an artifact is destroyed, the
casting wizard must roll a successful saving
throw vs. spell with a -4 penalty or perma-
nently lose all spellcasting abilities.
Power Word, Klll

Duration: Pemtanent
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 10-foot radius
Saving Throw: None
When a power word, kill spell is uttered,
one or more creatures of any type within the
spell range and area of effect are slain. The
power word slays one creature with up to 60
hit points, or it kills two or more creatures
with 10 or fewer hit points, up to a maxi-
mum of 120 hit points. The option to attack

Range: 0

Duration: 1 turn/level

Area of Effect: 10-foot-radius sphere
Saving Throw: Special
This spell enables the wizard to conjure
up an immobile, opaque globe of shimmer-
ing, multi-colored light to surround him.
giving protection from all forms of attadt.
This scintillating sphere flashes in all colors
of the visible spectrum. Seven of the colors
have distinct powers and purposes. Any
creature with fewer than 8 Hit Dice is blind-
ed for 2d4 tums by the colors of the sphere.
Only the spellcaster can pass in and out of
the prismatic sphere without harm.
although he can cast it over others to protect
them. The sphere can be destroyed, color by
color, in consecutive order, by various mag-
ical effects; however, the first must be
brought down before the second can be
affected, etc. Any creature passing through
the barrier receives the effect of every color
still remaining. Note that typically the
upper hemisphere of the globe is visible, as
the spellcaster is at the center of the sphere,
so the lower half is usually hidden by the
floor surface he is standing upon. The colors
and effects of the prismatic sphere, as well
as what will negate each globe, are shown
on the accompanying table.
Note that a rod of cancellation or a Mor-
denkainen's disjunction spell will destroy a
prismatic sphere (but an anti-magic shell
will fail to penetrate it). Otherwise, any-
thing short of an artifact or relic entering the
sphere is destroyed, and any creature is sub-
iect to the effects of every color still active-
i.e., 70-140 points of damage plus death.

Shape Change (Alteration)
Range: 0
Components: V, 5, M
Duration: 1 tum/level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
With this spell, a wizard is able to assume
the fon-n of any living thing or creature
below demigod status (greater or lesser dei-
ty, singular dragon type, or the like). The
spellcaster becomes the creature he wishes,
and has all of the abilities save those depen-
dent upon lntelligence, innate magical abili-
ties, and magic resistance, for the mind of
the creature is that of the spellcaster. Thus
he can change into a griffon and fly away,
then to an efreet and fly through a roaring
flame, and then to a titan to lift up a wagon,
etc. These creatures have whatever hit
points the wizard has at the time of the
shape change. Each alteration in form
requires but a second. No system shock is
I96
incurred.
Example: A wizard is in combat and
assumes the form of a will o’ wisp, and when
this form is no longer useful, the wizard
changes into a stone golem and walks away.
When pursued, the golem-shape is changed
to that of a flea, which hides upon a horse
until it can hop off and become a bush. If
detected as the latter, the wizard can become
a dragon, an ant, or just about anything he
is familiar with.
A wizard adopting another form also
adops its vulnerabilities. For example, a
wizard who becomes a spectre is powerless
in daylight, and is subject to being tumed,
controlled, or destroyed by opposing cler-
ics. Unlike similar spells, a wizard who is
killed in another form does not revert to his
original shape, which may disallow certain
types of revivification.
The material component is a jade circlet
worth no less than 5,000 gp, which shatters
at the end of the spell's duration. ln the
meantime. the circlet is left in the wake of



the shape change, and premature shattering
ends the spell immediately.
Succor (Alteration, Enchantment)
Reversible
Range: Touch
Components: V. S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 to 4 days
Area of Effect: 1 individual
Saving Throw: None
By casting this spell, the wizard creates a
powerful magic in some specially prepared
obiect—a statuette, a jeweled rod, a gem,
etc. This obiect radiates magic, for it con-
tains the power to instantaneously trans-
port its possessor to the abode of the wizard
who created it. Once the item is enchanted,
the wizard must give it willingly to an indi-
vidual, at the same time infonning him of a
command word to be spoken when the item
is to be used. To make use of the item, the
recipient must speak the command word at
the same time that he rends or breaks the
item. When this is done, the individual and
all that he is wearing and carrying are
instantly transported to the abode of the
wizard. No other creatures can be affected.
The reversed application of the spell
transports the wizard to the immediate
vicinity of the possessor of the spelled item,
when it is broken and the command word
said. The wiurd will have a general idea of
the location and situation of the item pos-
sessor, but has no choice whether or not to
go (making this a rare casting indeedl).
The material components used include
gemstones totaling not less than 5,000 gp
value; whether it is a faceted gem or not is
immaterial. The components can be
enchanted only once per month (usually on
a night of a clear. full moon). At that
time,the object is set for the type of succor
and its final destination (either the location
of the spellcasting or an area well known to
the wizard).
Temporal Stasls (Alteration)
Reversible
Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S. M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None
Upon casting this spell, the wizard places
the recipient creature into a state of sus-
pended animation. This cessation of time
means that the creature does not grow older.
lts body functions virtually cease. This state
persists until the magic is removed by a dis-
pel magic spell or the reverse of the spell
(temporal reinstatement) is uttered. Note
Wizard Spells (9th Level) 
that the reverse requires only a single word
and no somatic or material components.
The material component of a temporal
stasis spell is a powder composed of dia-
mond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire dust,
each crushed stone of at least 100 gp value.
Time Stop (Alteration)
Range: O
Components: V
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 15-foot-radius sphere
Saving Throw: None
Upon casting a time stop spell, the wizard
causes the ﬂow of time to stop for one round
in the area of effect. Outside this area the
sphere simply seems to shimmer for an
instant. lnside the sphere, the caster is free
to act for 1d3 rounds of apparent time. The
wizard can move and act freely within the
area where time is stopped, but all other
creatures, except for those of demigod and
greater status or unique creatures, are fro-
zen in their actions, for they are literally
between ticks of the time clock. (The spell
duration is subjective to the caster.) Nothing
can enter the area of effect without being
stopped in time also. If the wizard leaves the
area, the spell is immediately negated.
When the spell duration ceases, the wizard
is again operating in normal time.
Note: lt is recommended that the DM use
a stop watch or silently count to time this
spell. If the caster is unable to complete the
intended action before the spell duration
expires, he will probably be caught in an
embarrassing situation. The use of a tele-
port spell before the expiration of the time
stop spell is permissible.
Welrd (Illusion/Phantasml
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 20-foot radius
Saving Throw: Special
This spell confronts those affected by it
with phantasmal images of their most feared
enemies. forcing an imaginary combat that
seems real, but actually occurs in the blink
of an eye. When this spell is cast, the wizard
must be able to converse with the victims to
bring the spell into being. During the cast-
ing, the wizard must call out to the creatures
to be affected, infomiing one or all that their
final fate, indeed their doom, is now upon
them.
The force of the magic is such that even if
the creatures make their saving throws vs.
spell, fear will paralyze them for a full
round, and they will lose 1d4 Strength
points from this fear (the lost Strength will
I91
retum in one tum). Failure to save vs. spell
causes the creature or creatures to face their
nemeses, the opponents most feared and
inimical to them. Actual combat must then
take place, for no magical means of escape is
possible. The foe fought is real for all intents
and purposes. Affected creatures that lose.
die. lf a creature's phantasmal nemesis from
the weird spell is slain, then the creature
emerges with no damage, no loss of items
seemingly used in the combat, and no loss of
spells likewise seemingly expended. Experi-
ence for defeating the weird is gained if
applicable. Although each round of combat
seems nonnal, it takes but 1/in of a round.
During the course of the spell, the caster
must concentrate fully upon maintaining it.
if the combat goes beyond ten rounds, those
who saved against the spell can take action.
lf the caster is disturbed, the weird spell
ends immediately. Creatures attacked while
paralyzed with fear are free of the paralysis
immediately.
Wlsh (Conluration/Summoning)
Range: Unlimited
Components: V
Duration: Special
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special
The wish spell is a more potent version of
a limited wish. If it is used to alter reality
with respect to damage sustained by a party,
to bring a dead creature to life, or to escape
from a difficult situation by lifting the spell-
caster (and his party) from one place to
another, it will not cause the wizard any dis-
ability. Other forrns of wishes, however,
cause the spellcaster to weaken (-3 on
Strength) and require 2d4 days of bed rest
due to the stresses the wish places upon
time, space. and his body. Regardless of
what is wished for, the exact terminology of
the wish spell is likely to be carried out.
Casting a wish spell ages the caster five
years.
This discretionary power of the DM is
necessary in order to maintain game bal-
ance. As wishing another creature dead
would be grossly unfair, for example, your
DM might well advance the spellcaster to a
future period in which the creature is no
longer alive, effectively putting the wishing
character out of the campaign.



Appendix 4= Priest Spells
Prlest Spells Note
Following the name
of each priest spell, notice that a magical
school is given in parentheses. This is for
reference purposes only. For instance, Wis-
dom bonuses apply to saving throws vs.
enchantrnent/charrn spells. lf the appropri-
ate magical school were not listed with
priest spells, it would be hard to figure out
which spells were considered to be
enchantmentl charms. There are a few other
reasons one might need to know this infor-
mation. The priest spells are not really orga-
nized into magical schools, but rather into
spheres of inﬂuence, as described on page 34
and in Chapter 7; Magic.
See Appendix 2 on page 129 for explana-
tions of what the spell parameters (Range,
Components, etc.) mean.
first-Level Spells
Animal frlendshlp
(Enchantment/Chann)
Sphere: Animal
Range: 10 yards
Components: V, 5, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 hour
Area of Effect: 1 animal
Saving Throw: Neg.
By means of this spell, the caster is able to
show any animal of animal intelligence to
semi-intelligence (i.e., Intelligence 1-4) that
he desires friendship. lf the animal does not
roll a successful saving throw vs. spell im-
mediately when the spell is begun, it stands
quietly while the caster finishes the spell.
Thereafter. it follows the caster about. The
spell functions only if the caster actually
wishes to be the animal's friend. If the caster
has ulterior motives, the animal always
senses them (e.g., the caster intends to eat
the animal, send it ahead to set off traps,
etcv).
The caster can teach the befriended ani-
mal three specific tricks or tasks for each
point of Intelligence it possesses. Typical
tasks are those taught to a dog or similar pet
(i.e., they cannot be complex). Training for
each such trick must be done over a period
of one week, and all must be done within
three months of acquiring the creature. Dur-
ing the three-month period, the animal will
not harm the caster, but if the creature is left
alone for more than a week, it will revert to
its natural state and act accordingly.
The caster can use this spell to attract up
to 2 Hit Dice of animal(s) per experience
level he possesses. This is also the maximum
total Hit Dice of the animals that can be at-
tracted and trained at one time: no more
than twice the caster's experience level.
Only unaligned animals can be attracted,
befriended, and trained.
The material components of this spell are
the caster's holy symbol and a piece of food
the animal likes.
Bless (Con]uratlon/Summoning)
Reversible
Sphere: All
Range: 60 yards
Components: V. S, M
Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 50-foot cube
Saving Throw: None
Upon uttering the bless spell, the caster
raises the morale of friendly creatures and
any saving throw rolls they make against
fear effects by +1. Furthermore, it raises
their attack dice rolls by +1. A blessing,
I98
however, affects only those not already en-
gaged in melee combat. The caster deter-
mines at what range (up to 60 yards) he will
cast the spell. At the instant the spell is com-
pleted, it affects all creatures in a 50-foot
cube centered on the point selected by the
caster (thus, affected creatures leaving the
area are still subject to the spell‘s effect;
those entering the area after the casting is
completed are not).
A second use of this spell is to bless a sin-
gle item (for example, a crossbow bolt for
use against a rakshasa). The weight of the
item is limited to one pound per caster level
and the effect lasts until the item is used or
the spell duration ends.
Multiple bless spells are not cumulative.
in addition to the verbal and somatic ges-
ture components, the bless spell requires
holy water.
This spell can be reversed by the priest to
a curse spell upon enemy creatures that
lowers their morale and attack rolls by -1.
The curse requires the sprinkling of unholy
water.
Combine (Evocation)
Sphere: All
Range: Touch
Components; V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: The circle of priests
Saving Throw: None
Using this spell, three to five priests com-
bine their abilities so that one of them casts
spells and turns undead at an enhanced
level. The highest level priest (or one of
them, if two or more are tied for highest)
stands alone, while the others ioin hands in
a surrounding circle. The central priest casts
the combine spell. He temporarily gains one
level for each priest in the circle, up to a
maximum gain of four levels. The level in-
crease affects tuming undead and spell de-
tails that vary with the caster's level. Note
that the central priest gains no additional
spells and that the group is limited to his
currently memorized spells.
The encircling priests must concentrate
on maintaining the combine effect. They
lose all Annor Class bonuses for shield and
Dexterity. If any of them has his concentra-
tion broken, the combine spell ends immedi-
ately. lf the combine spell is broken while
the central priest is in the act of casting a
spell. that spell is ruined just as if the caster
was disturbed. Spells cast in combination
have the full enhanced effect, even if the
combine is broken before the duration of
the enhanced spell ends. Note that the com-
bination is not broken if only the central
caster is disturbed.



Command (l-Incliannnent/Charm)
Sphere: Charm
Range: 30 yards
Component: V
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the priest to command
another creature with a single word. The
command must be uttered in a language un-
derstood by the creature. The subject will
obey to the best of his/its ability only as
long as the command is absolutely clear and
unequivocal; hence, a command of “Sui-
cide!” is ignored. A command to "Die!"
causes the creature to fall in a faint or cata-
leptic state for one round, but thereafter the
creature revives and is alive and well. Typi-
cal commands are bad<, halt, ﬂee, nm,
stop, fall, go, leave, surrender, sleep, rest,
etc. No command affects a creature for
more than one round; undead are not af-
fected at all. Creatures with lntelligence of
13 (high) or more, or those with 6 or more
Hit Dice (or experience levels) are entitled to
a saving throw vs. spell, adjusted for Wis-
dom. (Creatures with 13 or higher lntelli-
gence and 6 Hit Dice/levels get only one
saving throw!)
Create Water (Alteration)
Reversible
Sphere: Elemental (Water)
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Up to 27 cubic feet
Saving Throw: None
When the priest casts a create water spell,
up to four gallons of Water are generated for
every experience level of the caster (e.g., a
2nd-level priest creates up to eight gallons of
water, a 3rd-level up to 12 gallons, etc.).
The water is clean and drinkable (it is iust
like rain water). The created water can be
dispelled within a roimd of its creation, oth-
erwise its magic fades, leaving normal water
that can be used, spilled, evaporated, etc.
Reversing the spell, destroy water, obliter-
ates without trace (no vapor, mist, fog, or
steam) a like quantity of water. Water can
be created or destroyed in an area as small
as will actually contain the liquid, or in an
area as large as 27 cubic feet (1 cubic yard).
The spell requires at least a drop of water
to create, or a pinch of dust to destroy, water.
Note that water can neither be created
nor destroyed within a creature. For refer-
ence purposes, water weighs about B ‘/z
pounds per gallon, and a cubic foot of water
weighs approximately 64 pounds.
Priest Spells (lst level)
Cure Ught Wounds (Necromancy)
Reversible
Sphere: Healing
Range: Touch
Components: \/, S
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
When casting this spell and laying his
hand upon a creature, the priest causes 1d8
points of wound or other injury damage to
the creature's body to be healed. This heal-
ing cannot affect creatures without corpo-
real bodies, nor can it cure wounds of
creatures not living or of extraplanar origin.
The reversed spell, cause light wounds.
operates in the same manner, inﬂicting 1d8
points of damage. lf a creature is avoiding
this touch, an attack roll is needed to deter-
mine if the priest's hand strikes the oppo-
nent and causes such a wound.
Curing is permanent only insofar as the
creature does not sustain further damage;
caused wounds will heal—or can be cured-—
just as any normal injury.
Detect ivll (Divination)
Reversible
Sphere: All
Range: 120 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn + 5 rounds/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 10-foot path
Saving Throw: None
This spell discovers emanations of evil, or
of good in the case of the reverse spell, from
any creature, object, or area. Character
aligiment, however, is revealed only under
unusual circumstances: characters who are
strongly aligned, who do not stray from
their faith, and who are of at least 9th level
might radiate good or evil if intent upon ap-
propriate actions. Powerful monsters, such
as rakshasas or ki-rin. send forth emana-
tions of evil or good, even if polymorphed.
Aligned undead radiate evil, for it is this
power and negative force that enable them
to continue existing. An evilly cursed object
or unholy water radiates evil, but a hidden
trap or an unintelligent viper does not.
The degree of evil (faint, moderate,
strong. overwhelming) and possibly its gen-
eral nature (expectant, malignant, gloating,
etc.) can be noted. If the evil is overwhelm-
ing, the priest has a 10% chance per level of
detecting its general bent (lawful, neutral,
chaotic). The duration of a detect eoil (or
detect good) spell is one tum plus five
rounds per level of the priest. Thus a priest
of 1st experience level can cast a spell with a
15-round duration, at 2nd level he can cast a
Z0-round duration spell, etc. The spell has a
I99
path of detection 10 feet wide in the direc-
tion in whit-Jr the priest is facing. The priest
must concentrate—stop, have quiet, and in-
tently seek to detect the aura—for at least
one round to receive a reading.
The spell requires the use of the priest's
holy symbol as its material component,
with the priest holding it before him.
Detect Magic (Divination)
Sphere: Divination
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 tum
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 10-foot path
Saving Throw: None
When the detect magic spell is cast, the
priest detects magical radiations in a path 10
feet wide and up to 30 yards long, in the di-
rection he is facing. The intensity of the
magic can be detected (dim, faint, moder-
ate. strong, overwhelming). The caster has
a 10% chance per level to determine the
sphere of the magic, but unlike the wizard
version of the spell, the type of magic (alter-
ation. coniuration, etc.) cannot be divined.
The caster can tum, scanning a 60° arc per
round. A stone wall of one foot or more
thickness. solid metal of one inch thickness.
or a yard or more of solid wood blocks the
spell.
The spell requires the use of the priest's
holy symbol.
Detect Poison (Divination)
Sphere: Divination
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the priest to determine
if an object has been poisoned or is poison-
ous. One object, or a 5-foot cubic mass, can
be checked per round. The priest has a 5%
chance per level of determining the exact
type of poison.
The material component is a strip of spe-
cially blessed vellum, which tums black if
poison is present.



'% Priest Spells ( I st level)
Detect Snares It Plts (Divination)
Sphere: Divination
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 4 rounds/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 10-foot path, 40 feet long
Saving Throw: None
Upon casting this spell, the caster is able
to detect snares, pits. deadfalls and similar
hazards along a 10-foot-wide by 40-foot-
long path. Such hazards include simple pits,
deadfalls, snares of wildemess Creatures
(e.g., trapdoor spiders, giant sundews, ant
lions. etc.), and primitive traps constnicted
of natural materials (mantraps, missile
trips, hunting snares, etc.). The spell is
directional—the caster must face the desired
direction to determine if a pit exists or a trap
is laid in that direction. The caster experi-
ences a feeling of danger from the direction
of a detected hazard, which increases as the
danger is approached. The caster leams the
general nature of the danger (pit, snare, or
deadfall) but not its exact operation, nor
how to disarm it. Close examination, how-
ever, enables the caster to sense what
intended actions might trigger it. The spell
detects certain natural hazards—quicksand
(snare), sinkholes (pit), or unsafe walls of
natural rock (deadfall). Other hazards, such
as a cavem that Floods during rain, an
unsafe construction, or a naturally poison-
ous plant, are not revealed. The spell does
not detect magical traps (save those that
operate by pit, deadfall, or snarirtg; see the
Znd-level spell trip and the 3rd-level spell,
snare), nor those that are mechanically
complex, nor does it detect snares or dead-
falls that have been rendered safe or inac-

The caster must have his holy symbol to

Endure Cold/lndure Heat (Alteration)
Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Components: V. S
Duration: 1‘/z hours/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
The creature receiving this spell is pro-
tected from normal extremes of cold or heat
(depending on which application the priest
selects at the time of casting). The creature
can stand unprotected in temperatures as
lowas -30° F. or as high as 130° F.(depend-
ing on application) with no ill effect. Tem-
peratures beyond these limits inflict 1 point
of damage per hour of exposure for every
degree beyond the limit. The spell is imme-
diately cancelled if the recipient is affected
by any non-nomtal heat or cold, such as
magic, breath weapons, and so on. The can-
cellation occurs regardless of the applica-
tion and regardless of whether a heat or cold
effect hits the character (e.g.. an endure cold
spell is cancelled by magical heat or fire as
well as by magical cold). The recipient of
the spell does not suffer the first 10 points of
damage (after any applicable saving
throws) from the heat or cold during the
round in which the spell is broken. The spell
ends instantly if either resist fire or resist
cold is cast upon the recipient.
Entangle (Alteration)
Sphere: Plant
Range: B0 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 tum
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 40-foot cube
Saving Throw: ‘/2
By means of this spell, the caster is able to
cause plants in the area of effect to entangle
creatures within the area. The grasses,
weeds. bushes. and even trees wrap. twist.
and entwine about the creatures, holding
them fast for the duration of the spell. Any
creature entering the area is subject to this
effect. A creature that rolls a successful sav-
ing throw vs. spell can escape the area,
moving at only 10 feet per round until out of
the area. Exceptionally large (gargantuan)
or strong creatures may suffer little or no
distress from this spell, at the DM's option,
based on the strength of the entangling
plants.
The material component is the caster's
holy symbol,
Faerie Ilre (Alteration)
Sphere: Weather
Range: 80 yards
Component: V, M
Duration: 4 roundsl level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 10 sq. feet/level within
a 40-foot radius
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the caster to outline one
or more objects or creatures with a pale
glowing light. The number of subjects out-
lined depends upon the number of square
feet the caster can affect. Sufficient footage
enables several objects or creatures to be
outlined by the faerie fire spell, but one
must be fully outlined before the next is
begun. and all must be within the area of
effect. Outlined objects or creatures are visi-
ble at 80 yards in the dark, 40 yards if the
viewer is near a bright light source. Out-
lined creatures are easier to strike, thus
opponents gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls in
darkness (including moonlit nights) and a
+1 bonus in twilight or better. Note that
ZOO
outlining can render otherwise invisible
creatures visible. However, it cannot out-
line noncorporeal. ethereal, or gaseous
creatures. Nor does the light come any-
where close to sunlight. Therefore it has no
special effect on undead or dark-dwelling
creatures. The faerie fire can be blue. green.
or violet according to the word of the caster
at the time of casting. The faerie fire does
not cause any harm to the object or creature
thus outlined.
The material component is a small piece
of foxfire.
lnvlslblllty to Animals (AlteraHon)
Sphere: Animal
Range: Touch
Components: S, M
Duration: 1 tum + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature touchedl level
Saving Throw: None
When an invisibility to animals spell is
cast, the creature touched becomes totally
undetectable by nonnal animals with Intel-
ligences under 6. Nonrtal animals includes
giant-sized varieties, but it excludes any
with magical abilities or powers. The
enchanted individual is able to walk among
such animals or pass through them as if he
did not exist. For example. this individual
could stand before the hungriest of lions or a
tyrannosaurus rex and not be molested or
even noticed. However, a nightmare. hell
hound, or winter wolf would certainly be
aware of the individual. For every level the
caster has achieved, one creature can be ren-
dered invisible. Any recipient attacking
while this spell is in effect ends the spell
immediately (for himself only).
The material component of this spell is
holly mbbed over the recipient.
lnvlslblllty to Undead (Abiuration)
Sphere: Necromantic
Range: Touch
Components: V. S, M
Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Special
This spell causs affected undead to lose
track of and ignore the warded aeature for the
duration of the spell. Undead of 4 or fewer Hit
Dice are automatically affected, but those
with more Hit Dice receive a saving throw vs.
spell to avoid the effect. Note that a priest pro-
tected by this spell cannot tum affected
undead. The spell ends immediately if the
recipient makes any attack, although casting
spells sudt as cure light wounds, augury, or
chant does not end the ward.
The material component is the priest's
holy symbol.



llght (Alteration)
Reversible
Sphere: Sun
Range: 120 yards
Components: V. S
Duration: 1 hour 4- 1 tum/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 20-foot-radius globe
Saving Throw: Special
This spell causes a luminous glow within
2.0 feet of the spell's center. The area of light
thus caused is equal in brightness to torch-
light. Objects in darkness beyond this
sphere can be seen, at best, as vague and
shadowy shapes. The spell is centered on a
point selected by the caster, and he must
have a line of sight or unobstructed path to
that point when the spell is cast. Light can
spring from air. rock, metal, wood, or
almost any similar substance. The effect is
immobile unless it is specifically centered on
a movable object or mobile creature. lf this
spell is cast upon a creature, any applicable
magic resistance and saving throws must be
rolled. Successful resistance negates the
spell, while a successful saving throw indi-
cates that the spell is centered immediately
behind the creature, rather than upon the
creature itself. A light spell centered on the
visual organs of a creature blinds it, reduc-
ing its attack and saving throw rolls by 4
and worsening its Armor Class by 4. The
caster can extinguish the light at any time by
uttering a single word. Light spells are not
curnulative—multiple castings do not pro-
vide a brighter light.
The spell is reversible, causing darkness
in the same area and under the same condi-
tions as the light spell, but with half the
duration. Magical darkness is equal to that
of an unlit interior room—pitch darkness.
Any normal light source or magical light
source of lesser intensity than full daylight
does not function in magical darkness. A
darkness spell cast directly against a light
spell cancels both, and vice versa.
locate Animals or Plants
(Divination)
Sphere: Divination (Animal, Plant)
Range: 100 yards + Z0 yd./ level
Components: V, 5. M
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 20-foot-wide path 20 yards

Saving Throw: None
The caster can find the direction and dis-
tance of any one type of animal or plant he
desires. The caster, facing in a direction,
thinks of the animal or plant, and then
knows if any such animal or plant is within
range. lf so, the exact distance and approxi-
Priest Spells ( I st level)
mate number present is leamed. During
each round of the spell's duration, the caster
can face in only one direction, i.e., only a
20-foot-wide path can be known. The spell
lasts one round per level of experience of the
caster, while the length of the path is 100
yards plus 20 yards per level of experience.
(At the DM's option, some casters may be
able to locate only those animals [or plants)
associated closely with their own mythos.)
The material component is the caster‘s
holy symbol.
While the exact chance of locating a spe-
cific type of animal or plant depends on the
details and circumstances of the locale, the
general frequency of the subject can be used
as a guideline: common = 50%, uncom-
mon = 30%, rare I 15%, and very rare I
5% . Most herbs grow in temperate regions,
while most spices grow in tropical regions.
Most plants sought as spell components or
for magical research are rare or very rare.
The results of this spell are always deter-
mined by the DM.
Magical Stone (Enchantment)
Sphere: Combat
Range: O
Components: V, S. M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
By using this spell. the priest can tempo-
rarily enchant up to three small pebbles, no
larger than sling bullets. The magical stones
can then be hurled or slung at an opponent.
If hurled, they can be throum up to 30
yards, and all three can be thrown in one
round. The character using them must roll
normally to hit, although the magic of the
stones enables any character to be proficient
with them. The stones are considered +1
weapons for determining if a creature can be
struck (those struck only by magical weap-
ons, for instance), although they do not
have an attack or damage bonus. Each stone
that hits inflicts 1d4 points of damage, 2d4
points against undead. The magic in each
stone lasts for but one-half hour or until
used.
The material components are the priest's
holy symbol and three small pebbles,
unworked by tools or magic of any type.

Pass Without Trace
(Enchantment/Charm)
Sphere: Plant
Range: Touch
Components: V. S, M
Duration: 1 tum/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, the recipient can
move through any type of terrain—rnud.
snow, dust, etc.—and leave neither foot-
prints nor scent. The area that is passed over
radiates magic for ido tums after the affect-
ed creature passes. Thus, tracking a person
or other creature covered by this spell is
impossible by normal means. Of course,
intelligent tracking techniques, such as
using a spiral search pattem, can result in
the trackers picking up the trail at a point
where the spell has worn off.
The material component of this spell is a
sprig of pine or evergreen, which must be
bumed and the ashes powdered and scat-
tered when the spell is cast.
Protection from Evll (Ablurationl
Reversible
Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 3 roundsl level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, it creates a magical
barrier around the recipient at a distance of
one foot. The barrier moves with the recipi-
ent and has three major effects:
First, all attacks made by evil or evilly
enchanted creatures against the protected
creature receive a penalty of -2 to each
attack roll, and any saving throws caused
by such attacks are made by the protected
creature with a +2 bonus.
Second, any attempt to exercise mental
control over the protected creature (if, for
example, it had been channed by a vampire)
or to invade and take over its mind (as by a
ghost‘s magic jar attack) is blocked by this
spell. Note that the protection does not pre-
vent a vampire’s charm itself, nor end it, but
it does prevent the vampire from exercising
mental control through the barrier. Like-
wise, an outside life force is merely kept out,
and would not be expelled if in place before
the protection was cast.
Third, the spell prevents bodily contact
by creatures of an extraplanar or conjured
nature (such as aerial servants, elementals,
imps, invisible stalkers, salamanders, water
weirds, xom. and others). This causes the
natural (body) weapon attacks of such crea-
tures to fail and the creature to recoil if such



'i' Priest Spells (Ind Level)
attacks require touching the protected crea-
ture. Animals or monsters summoned or
conjured by spells or similar magic are like-
wise hedged from the character. This pro-
tection ends if the protected character
makes a melee attack against or tries to
force the barrier against the blocked crea-
ture.
To complete this spell, the priest uses holy
water or burning incense.
This spell can be reversed to become pro-
tection from good; the second and third
benefits remain unchanged.
The material components for the reverse
are a circle of unholy water or smoldering
dung.
Purify food 8. Drlnlr (Alteration)
Reversible
Sphere: All
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 cubic foot/level,
10-foot-square area
Saving Throw: None
When cast, this spell makes spoiled. rot-
ten, poisonous, or otherwise contaminated
food and water pure and suitable for eating
and drinking. Up to one cubic foot of food
and drink per level can be thus made suit-
able for consumption. This spell does not
prevent subsequent natural decay or spoil-
age. Unholy water and similar food and
drink of signiﬁcance is spoiled by purify
food and drink, but the spell has no effect on
creatures of any type nor upon magical
potions.
The reverse of the spell is putrefy food
and drink. This spoils even holy water. lt
likewise has no effect upon creatures or
potions.
Remove fear [Abjuggﬂgnj
Reversible
Sphere: Charm
Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature/4 levels
Saving Throw: Special
The priest instills courage in the spell
recipient, raising the creature's saving throw
rolls against magical fear attacks by +4 for
one turn. lf the recipient has recently (that
day) failed a saving throw against such an
attack, the spell immediately grants another
saving throw, with a +4 bonus to the die
roll. For every four levels of the caster, one
ueature can be affected by the spell (one
creature at levels 1 through 4, two creatures
at levels S through 8, etc.).
The reverse of the spell, cause fear, causes
one creature to flee in panic at maximum
movement speed away from the caster for
1d4 rounds. A successful saving throw
against the reversed effect negates it. and
any Wisdom adjustment also applies. Of
course, cause fear can be automatically
countered by remove fear and vice versa.
Neither spell has any effect on undead of
any sort.

When the priest casts a sanctuary spell.
any opponent attempting to strike or other-
wise directly attack the protected creature
must roll a saving throw vs. spell. lf the sav-
ing throw is successful, the opponent can
attack normally and is unaffected by that
casting of the spell. lf the saving throw is
failed, the opponent loses track of and total-
ly ignores the warded creature for the dura-
tion of the spell. Those not attempting to
attack the subject remain unaffected. Note
that this spell does not prevent the opera-
tion of area attacks (ﬁreball, ice stonn.
etc.). While protected by this spell, the sub-
ject cannot take direct offensive action with-
out breaking the spell, but may use
non-attack spells or otherwise act in any
way that does not violate the prohibition
against offensive action. This allows a
warded priest to heal wounds, for example,
or to bless, perform an augury, chant, cast a
light in the area (not upon an opponentl),
and so on.
The components of the spell include the
priest's holy symbol and a small silver rnir-
ror.

The recipient of this spell gains the benefit
of a bless spell ( +1 to attack rolls and saving
throws) and a special bonus of 1d8 addition-
al hit points for the duration of the spell.
The nid spell enables the recipient to actu-

tional hit points. The ﬁghter now has 11 hit

then hit for 7 points of damage, 2 normal hit
points and all 5 temporary hit points are
lost. He then receives a cure light wounds

ing him to his original 8 hit points.
Note that the operation of the spell is
unaffected by permanent hit point losses
due to energy drain, Hit Die losses, the loss
of a familiar, or the operation of certain arti-
facts; the temporary hit point gain is figured
from the new, lower total.
The material components of this spell are
a tiny strip of white cloth with a sticky sub-
stance (such as tree sap) on the ends, plus
the priest's holy symbol.



Augury (Divination)
Sphere: Divination
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2 rounds
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
The priest casting an augury spell seeks to
divine whether an action in the immediate
future (within one—half hour) will be for the
benefit of. or harmful to, the party. For
example, if a party is considering the
destniction of a weird seal that closes a por-
tal, an nugury spell can be used to find if
weal or woe will be the immediate result. lf
the spell is successful, the DM yields some
indication of the probable outcome: “weal,”
"woe," or possibly a cryptic puzzle or
rhyme. The base chance for receiving a
meaningful reply is 70%, plus 1% for each
level of the priest casting the spell, e.g., 71 %
at 1st level, 72% at 2nd, etc. Your DM deter-
mines any adiustments for the particular
conditions of each augury.
For example, if the question is ‘Will we do
well if we venture to the third levell” and a
terrible troll guarding 10,000 s.p. and a
shield +1 lurks near the entrance to the
level (which the DM estimates the party
could beat after a hard fight) the augury
might be: "Great risk brings great reward
lf the troll is too strong for the party, the
augury might be: "Woe and destniction
await!" Likewise, a party casting several
auguries about the same action in quick suc-
cession might receive identical answers,
reyrdless of the dice rolls.
The material component for augury is a
set of gem-inlaid sticks, dragon bones, or
similar tokens of at least 1,000 gp value
(which are not expended in casting).
larkskln (Alteration)

Saving Throw: None
When a priest casts the barlcskin spell
upon a creature, its skin becomes as tough
as bark, increasing its base Armor Class to
AC 6, plus 1 AC for every four levels of the
priest: Amior Class 5 at 4th level, Armor
Class 4 at 8th, and so on. This spell does not
function in combination with normal armor
or any magical protection. ln addition, sav-
ing throw rolls vs. all attack forms except
magic gain a +1 bonus. This spell can be
placed on the caster or on any other creature
he touches.
in addition to his holy symbol, the caster

Chant (Coniuration/Summoning)
Sphere: Combat
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: Time of chanting
Casting Time: Z rounds
Area of Effect: 30-foot radius
Saving Throw: None
By means of the chant spell, the priest
brings special favor upon himself and his
party, and causes harm to his enemies.
When the chant spell is completed, all
attack and damage rolls and saving throws
made by those in the area of effect who are
friendly to the priest gain +1 bonuses,
while those of the priest's enemies suffer — 1
penalties. This bonus/penalty continues as
long as the caster continues to chant the
mystic syllables and is stationary. An inter-
ruption, however, such as an attack that
succeeds and causes damage, grappling the
chanter, or a silence spell, breaks the spell.
Multiple chants are not cumulative; how-
ever, if the 3rd-level prayer spell is spoken
while a priest of the same religious persua-
sion (not merely alignment!) is chanting, the
effect is increased to +2 and -Z.

Range: 80 yards
Components: V, S
S al
Duration: peci
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 person or mammal
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell affects any single person or
mammal it is cast upon. The creature then
regards the caster as a tnisted friend and ally
to be heeded and protected. The term per-
son includes any bipedal human, demihu-
man or humanoid of man-size or smaller,
including brownies, dryads, dwarves.
elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves.
halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans,
kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies,
sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a
10th-level fighter is included, while an ogre
is not.
The spell does not enable the caster to
control the charmed creature as if it were an
automaton, but any word or action of the
caster is viewed in the most favorable way.
Thus a charmed creature would not obey a
suicide command, but might believe the
caster if assured that the only chance to save
the caster's life is for the creature to hold
back an onrushing red dragon for "just a
round or two" and if the charmed creature's
Z03
view of the situation suggests that this
course of action still allows a reasonable
chance of survival.
The subject's attitudes and priorities are
changed with respect to the caster, but basic
personality and alignment are not, A
request that a victim make itself defenseless,
give up a valued item, or even use a charge
from a valued item (espedally against form-
er associates or allies) might allow an irnme~
diate saving throw to see if the charm is
thrown off. Likewise, a charmed creature
does not necessarily reveal everything it
knows or draw maps of entire areas. Any
request may be refused, if such refusal is in
character and does not directly harm the
caster. The victim's regard for the caster
does not necessarily extend to the caster's
friends or allies. The victim does not react
well to the char-mer‘s allies making sugges-
tions such as, "Ask him this question. . .," nor
does the charmed creature put up with ver-
bal or physical abuse from the charmer's
associates, if this is out of character.
Note also that the spell does not empower
the caster with linguistic capabilities beyond
those he nonnally has. The duration of the
spell is a function of the charmed creature's
Intelligence, and it is tied to the saving
throw. The spell can be broken if a success-
ful saving throw is rolled. This saving throw
is checked on a periodic basis according to
the creature's Intelligence, even if the caster
has not overly strained the relationship.

If the caster harms, or attempts to harm,

or if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast
upon the charmed creature. the charm is
broken automatically.
If the subject of the chann person/charm
mammal spell successfully rolls its saving
throw vs. the spell, the effect is negated.

animal friendship spell, can keep the animal
near the caster's home base, if the caster
must leave for an extended period.

Detect Charm (Divination)
Reversible
Sphere: Divination
Range: 30 yards
Components; V, S
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 creaturel round
Saving Throw: None
When used by a priest, this spell can
detect if a person or monster is under the
inﬂuence of a charm spell, or similar control
such as hypnosis, suggestion, beguiling.
possession, etc. The creature rolls a saving
throw vs. spell and, if successful, the caster
learns nothing about that particular crea-
ture from the casting. A caster who learns
that a creature is being inﬂuenced has a 5%
chance per level to determine the exact type
of inﬂuence. Up to 10 different creatures can
be checked before the spell wanes. lf the
creature is under more than one such effect,
only the information that the charms exist is
gained. The type (since there are conﬂicting
emanations) is impossible to determine.
The reverse of the spell, undetectable
charm, completely masks all charms on a
single creature for Z4 hours.
Dust Devil (Coniuration/Summoning)
Sphere: Elemental (Air)
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, 5
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: Z rounds
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables a priest to conjure up a
weak air elemental—a dust devil of AC 4, Z
HD, MV 180 feet per round, one attack for
1d4 points of damage, which can be hit by
normal weapons. The dust devil appears as
a small whirlwind one foot in diameter at its
base, five feet tall. and three to four feet
across at the top. lt moves as directed by the
priest, but dissipates if it is ever separated
from the caster by more than 30 yards. its
winds are sufficient to put out torches, small
campfires, exposed lanterns, and other
small, open ﬂames of non-magical origin.
The dust devil can hold a gas cloud or a
creature in gaseous form at bay or push it
away from the caster (though it cannot
damage or disperse such a cloud). If skim-
ming along the ground in an area of loose
dust, sand. or ash, the dust devil picks up
those particles and disperses them in a 10-
foot-diameter cloud centered on itself. The
cloud obscures normal vision, and creatures
caught within are blinded while inside and
for one round after they emerge. A spell-
caster caught in the dust devil or its cloud
while casting must make a saving throw vs.
spell to keep his concentration, or the spell
is ruined. Any creature native to the ele-
mental plane of Air—even another dust
devil—can disperse a dust devil with a sin-
gle hit.
Enthrall (Enchantment/Charm)
Sphere: Charm
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 90-foot radius
Saving Throw: Neg.
A priest using this spell can enthrall an
audience that can fully understand his lan-
guage. Those in the area of effect must save
vs. spell or give the caster their undivided
attention, totally ignoring their surround-
ings. Those of a race or religion unfriendly
to the caster's have a +4 bonus to the roll.
Any Wisdom adjustment also applies. Crea-
tures with 4 or more levels or Hit Dice, or
with a Wisdom of 16 or better, are unaffect-
ed.
To cast the spell, the caster must speak
without interruption for a full round.
Thereafter, the enchant-ment lasts as long as
the priest speaks, to a maximum of one
hour. Those enthralled take no action while
the priest speaks. and for 1d3 rounds there-
after while they discuss the matter. Those
entering the area of effect must also save or
become enthralled. Those not enthralled are
50% likely every turn to hoot and jeer in
unison. If there is excessive ieering, the rest
are allowed a new saving throw. The speech
ends (but the 1d3 round delay still applies) if
the priest is successfully attacked or per-
forms any action other than speaking.
If the audience is attacked, the spell ends
and the audience reacts immediately, rolling
a reaction check with respect to the source
of the interruption, at a penalty of -10.
Note: When handling a large number of
saving throws for similar creatures, the DM
can assume an average to save time: e.g., a
crowd of 20 men with a base saving throw
of 16 (25% success chance) will have 15 men
enthralled and five not.
Flnd '|'l'l.p$ (Divination)
Sphere: Divination
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: 3 turns
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 10-foot path
Saving Throw: None
When a priest casts a find traps spell, all
traps~concealed normally or magically-
of magical or mechanical nature become
apparent to him. Note that this spell is direc-
tional, and the caster must face the desired
Z04
direction in order to detennine if a trap is
laid in that particular direction.
A trap is any device or magical ward that
meets three criteria: it can inﬂict a sudden
or unexpected result, the spellcaster would
view the result as undesirable or harmful,
and the hannful or undesirable result was
specifically intended as such by the creator.
Thus traps include alarms. glyphs. and simi-
lar spells or devices.
The caster leams the general nature of the
trap (magical or mechanical) but not its
exact effect, nor how to disarm it. Close
examination will, however, enable the cast-
er to sense what intended actions might trig-
ger it. Note that the caster's divination is
limited to his knowledge of what might be
unexpected and harmful. The spell cannot
predict actions of creatures (hence a con-
cealed murder hole or ambush is not a trap),
nor are natural hazards considered traps (a
cavem that ﬂoods during rain, a wall weak-
ened by age, a naturally poisonous plant). lf
the DM is using specific glyphs or sigils to
identify magical wards (see the glyph of
warding spell), this spell shows the form of
the glyph or mark. The spell does not detect
traps that have been disarmed or are other-
wise inactive.
flre Trap (Abiuntion, Evocation)
Sphere: Elemental (Fire)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent until discharged
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effen: Object touched
Saving Throw: 1/z
Any closeable item (book, box, bottle,
chest, coffer, coffin, door, drawer, and so
forth) can bewarded by a fire trap spell. The
spell is centered on a point selected by the
spellcaster. The item so trapped cannot have
a second closure or warding spell placed
upon it. A knock spell cannot affect a fire
trap in any way—as soon as the offending
party opens the item, the trap discharges.
As with most magical traps, a thief has only
half his normal find traps score to detect a
fire trap. Failure to remove it successfully
detonates it immediately. An unsuccessful
dispel magic spell will not detonate the
spell. When the trap is discharged, there will
be an explosion of five-foot radius from the
spells center. All creatures within this area
must roll saving throws vs. spell. Damage is
1d4 points plus 1 point per level of the cast-
er; half that total amount for creatures suc-
cessfully saving. (Underwater, this ward
inﬂicts half damage and creates a large
cloud of steam.) The item trapped is not
harmed by this explosion.
The caster can use the trapped object
without discharging it, as can any individ-
ual to whom the spell was specifically



attuned when cast (the method usually
involves a keyword).
To place this spell, the caster must trace
the outline of the closure with a stick of
charcoal and touch the center of the effect.
Attunement to another individual requires a
hair or similar object from the individual.
The material components are holly ber-
nes.
Flame Blade (Evocation)
Sphere: Elemental (Fire)
Range: O
Components: V, 5, M
Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round/2 levels
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 3' long, sword-like blade
Saving Throw: None
With this spell, the caster causes a blazing
ray of red-hot fire to spring forth from his
hand. This blade-like ray is wielded as if it
were a scimitar. If the caster successfully hits
with the ﬂame blade in melee combat, the
creature struck suffers 1d4 + 4 points of
damage, with a damage bonus of +2 (i.e.,
7-10 points) if the creature is undead or is
especially vulnerable to fire. lf the creature
is protected from fire, the damage inﬂicted
is reduced by 2 (i.e., 1d4 + Z points). Fire
dwellers and those using fire as an innate
attack form suffer no damage from the
spell. The ﬂame blade can ignite combusti-
ble materials such as parchment, straw, dry
sticks, cloth, etc. However, it is not a magi-
cal weapon in the normal sense of the term,
so creatures (other than undead) struck only
by magical weapons are not harmed by it.
This spell does not function underwater.
ln addition to the caster's holy symbol,
the spell requires a leaf of sumac as a materi-
al component.
Goodberry (Alteration, Evocation)
Reversible
Sphere: Plant
Range: Touch
Components: V, 5, M
Duration: 1 day + 1 day/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 2d4 fresh berries
Saving Throw: None
Casting a goodberry spell upon a handful
of freshly picked berries makes Zd4 of them
magical. The caster (as well as any other
caster of the same faith and 3rd or higher
level) can immediately discem which berries
are affected. A detect magic spell discovers
this also. Berries with the magic either
enable a hungry creature of approximately
man-size to eat one and be as well-
nourished as if a full normal meal were eat-
en. or else cure 1 point of physical damage
from wounds or other similar causes, sub-
Priest Spells (lnrl Level) f
iect to a maximum of 8 points of such curing
in any 24-hour period.
The reverse of the spell, badbeﬂy, causes
2d4 rotten berries to appear wholesome, but
each actually delivers 1 point of poison
damage (no saving throw) if ingested.
The material component of the spell is the
caster's holy symbol passed over the freshly
picked, edible berries to be enspelled (blue-
berries, blackberries, raspberries, currants,
gooseberries, etc.).
Heat Metal (Alteration)
Reversible
Sphere; Elemental (Fire)
Range: 40 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 7 rounds
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special
By means of the heat metal spell, the cast-
er is able to make ferrous metal (iron, iron
alloys, steel) extremely hot. Elven chain
mail is not affected, and magical metal
armor receives an item saving throw vs.
magical fire. lf this is successful, the heat
metal spell does not affect it.
On the first round of the spell, the metal
merely becomes very warm and uncomfor-
table to touch (this is also the effect on the
last melee round of the spell's duration).
During the second and sixth (next to the
last) rounds, heat causes blisters and dam-
age; in the third, fourth, and fifth rounds,
the metal becomes searing hot. causing
damage to exposed ﬂesh, as shown below:
Metal Temperature Damage per Round
VETY warm l'\On€
hot 1d4 poirtts
searing‘ 2d4 points
(') On the final round of searing, the
afflicted creature must roll a successful sav-
ing throw vs. spell or suffer one of the fol-
lowing disabilities: hand or foot—unusable
for 2d4 days, body—disabled 1d4 days.
head—unconscious 1d4 tums. This effect
can be completely removed by the 5th-level
priest heal spell or by normal rest.
Note also that materials such as wood,
leather, or ﬂammable cloth smolder and
burn if exposed to searing hot metal. Such
materials cause searing damage to exposed
flesh on the next round. Fire resistance
(spell, potion, or ring) or a protection from
fire spell totally negates the effects of a heat
metal spell, as does immersion in water or
snow, or exposure to a cold or ice storm
spell. This version of the spell does not func-
tion underwater. For every two experience
levels of the caster, the metal of one man-
sized creature can be affected (i.e., arms and
Z05
armor, or a single mass of metal equal to 50
potutds weight). Thus, a 3rd-level caster
would affect one such creature, a 4th- or
5th-level caster two, etc.
The reverse of the spell, chill metal,
counters a heat metal spell or else causes
metal to act as follows:
Metal Temperature Damage per Round
cold none
icy 1-2 hit points
freezing‘ 1d4 hit points
(') On the final round of freezing, the
afflicted creature must roll a successful sav-
ing throw vs. spell or stiffer from the numb-
ing effects of the cold. This causes the loss of
all feeling in a hand (or hands, if the DM
rules the saving throw was failed badly) for
1d4 days. During this time, the character's
grip is extremely weak and he cannot use
that hand for fighting or any other activity
requiring a firm grasp.
The chill metal spell is countered by a
1ESi$f cold spell, or by any great heat-
proximity to a blazing fire (not a mere
torch), a magical flaming sword, a wall of
ﬁre spell, etc. Underwater, this version of
the spell inﬂicts no damage, but ice immedi-
ately forms around the affected metal,
exerting an upward buoyancy.
Hold Person (Enchantment/Charm)
Sphere: Charm
Range: 120 yards
Components, V, S, M
Duration: 2 roundsl level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1d4 persons
in a Z0-foot cube
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell holds 1d4 humans, demihu-
mans, or humanoid creatures rigidly immo-
bile and in place for five or more rounds.
The hold person spell affects any bipedal
human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-
size or smaller, including brownies, dryads,
dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins,
half-elves, halﬂings, half-orcs, hobgoblins,
humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs,
pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others.
Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be held,
while an ogre could not.
The effect is centered on a point selected
by the caster, and it affects persons selected
by the caster within the area of effect. lf the
spell is cast at three persons, each gets a nor-
mal saving throw; if only two persons are
being enspelled, each rolls his saving throw
with a -1 penalty; if the spell is cast at but
one person, the saving throw die roll suffers
- 2 penalty. Saving throws are adjusted for
Wisdom. Those who succeed on their sav-
ing throws are totally unaffected by the
spell. Undead creatures cannot be held.



Priest Spells (Znd Level)
Held creatures cannot move or speak, but
they remain aware of events around them
and can use abilities not requiring motion or
speech. Being held does not prevent the
worsening of the subjects’ condition due to
wounds, disease, or poison. The priest cast-
ing the hold person spell can end the spell
with a single utterance at any time; other-
wise the duration is two rounds at 1st level.
four rounds at 2nd level, six rounds at 3rd
level, etc.
The spellcaster needs a small, straight
piece of iron as the material component of
this spell.
Know Alignment (Divination)
Reversible
Sphere: Divination
Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 turn
Casting time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 creature or object
Saving Throw: Neg.
A know alignment spell enables the priest
to exactly read the aura of a creature or an
aligned object (unaligned objects reveal
nothing). The caster must remain stationary
and concentrate on the subject for a full
round. lf the creature rolls a successful sav-
ing throw vs. spell, the caster leams nothing
about that particular creature from the cast-
ing. Certain magical devices negate the
power of the know alignment spell.
The reverse, undetectable alignment,
conceals the alignment of an object or crea-
ture for 24 hours.
Messenger (Enchantment/Charm)
Sphere: Animal
Range: 20 yards/level
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 day/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell enables the priest to call upon a
tiny (size T) creature of at least animal intel-
ligence to act as his messenger, The spell
does not affect giant animals and it does not
work on creatures of low (i.e., 5) intelli-
gence or higher. if the creature is within
range, the priest, using some type of food
desirable to the animal as a lure, can call the
animal to come. The animal is allowed a
saving throw vs. spell. If the saving throw is
failed, the animal advances toward the
priest and awaits his bidding. The priest can
communicate with the animal in a crude
fashion, telling it to go to a certain place,
but directions must be simple. The spell-
caster can attach some small item or note to
the animal. lf so instructed, the animal will
then wait at that location until the duration
of the spell expires. (Note that unless the in-
tended recipient of a message is expecting a
messenger in the tom-i of a small animal or
bird, the carrier may be ignored.) When the
spell’: duration expires, the animal or bird
returns to its normal activities. The in-
tended recipient of a message gains no com-
munication ability.
Obscurelnent (Alteration)
Sphere: Weather
Range: O
Components: V, S
Duration: 4 rounds/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw; None
This spell causes a misty vapor to arise
around the caster. It persists in this locale
for four rounds per caster level and reduces
the visibility ranges of all types of vision (in-
cluding infravislon) to 2d4 feet. The ground
area affected by the spell is a square progres-
sion based on the caster's level: a 10’ x 10‘
area at 1st level, a Z0‘ x 20 ' area at Znd
level, a 30’ x 30’ area at 3rd level, and so on.
The height of the vapor is restricted to 10
feet, although the cloud will otherwise ex-
pand to fill confined spaces. A strong wind
(such as the 3rd-level wizard spell, gust of
wind, can cut the duration of an obscure-
ment spell by 75% . This spell does not func-
tion under water.
Produce Flame (Alteration)
Sphere: Elemental (Fire)
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
A bright ﬂame, equal in brightness to a
torch, springs forth from the caster's palm
when he casts a produce flame spell. The
ﬂame does not hann the caster, but it is hot
and it causes the combustion of flammable
materials (paper, cloth, dry wood, oil, etc.).
The caster is capable of hurling the magical
flame as a missile, with a range of 40 yards
(considered short range). The flame ﬂashes
on impact, igniting combustibles within a
three—foot diameter of its center of impact,
and then it goes out. A creature struck by
the ﬂame suffers 1d4 +1 points of damage
and. if combustion occurs, must spend a
round extinguishing the fire or suffer addi-
tional damage assigned by the DM until the
fire is extinguished. A miss is resolved as a
grenade-like missile. if any duration re
mains to the spell, another ﬂame immedi-
ately appears in the caster's hand. The caster
can hurl a maximum of one flame per level,
Z06
but no more than one ﬂame per roimd.
The caster can snuff out magical flame
any time he desires, but fire caused by the
flame cannot be so extinguished. This spell
does not function under water.
Resist fire/Resist Cold (Alteration)
Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Components: V, 5, M
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is placed upon a creature
by a priest, the creature's body is toughened
to withstand heat or cold, as chosen by the
caster. Complete immunity to mild condi-
tions (standing naked in the snow or reach-
ing into an ordinary fire to pluck out a note)
is gained, The recipient can somewhat resist
intense heat or cold (whether natural or
magical in origin), such as red-hot charcoal,
a large amount of buming oil, flaming
swords, fire storms, fireballs, meteor
swanns, red dragon's breath, frostbrand
swords, ice storms, wands of frost, or White
dragon's breath. In all of these cases, the
temperature affects the creature to some ex-
tent. The recipient of the spell gains a bonus
of +3 to saving throws against such attack
forms and all damage sustained is reduced
by 50%; therefore, if the saving throw is
failed, the creature sustains one-half dam-
age, and if the saving throw is successful,
only one-quarter damage is sustained. Re-
sistance to fire lasts for one round for each
experience level of the priest placing the
spell.
The caster needs a drop of mercury as the
material component of this spell.
Silence, I5‘ Ratllus (Alteration)
Sphere: Guardian
Range: 120 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 15-foot-radius sphere
Saving Throw: None
Upon casting this spell, complete silence
prevails in the affected area. All sound is
stopped: conversation is impossible, spells
cannot be cast (or at least not those with
verbal components, if the optional compo-
nent rule is used), and no noise whatsoever
issues from or enters the area. The spell can
be cast into the air or upon an object, but
the effect is stationary unless cast on a mo-
bile obiect or creature. The spell lasts two
rounds for each level of experience of the
priest. The spell can be centered upon a
creature, and the effect then radiates from
the creature and moves as it moves. An un-



willing creature receives a saving throw
against the spell. If the saving throw is suc-
cessful, the spell effect is centered about one
foot behind the position of the subject crea-
ture at the instant of casting. This spell pro-
vides a defense against sound-based attacks.
such as harpy singing, horn of blasting, etc.
Slow Poison (Necromancy)
Sphere: Healing
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 hour/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is placed upon a poisoned
individual, it greatly slows the effects of
venom, if it is cast upon the victim before
the poison takes full effect. (This period,
known as the onset time, is known to the
DM.) While this spell does not neutralize
the venom, it does prevent it from substan-
tially hanning the individual for the dura-
tion of its magic in hopes that, during that
period, a full cure can be accomplished.
The material components of the slow poi-
son spell are the priest's holy symbol and a
bud of garlic that must be crushed and
smeared on the wound (or eaten if poison
was ingested).
Snake Charm (Enchantment/Charm)
Sphere: Animal
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 30-foot cube
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, a hypnotic pattem
is set up that causes one or more snakes to
cease all activity except a semi-erect, swaying
movement. if the snakes are charmed while
i.r\ a torpor, the duration of the spell is 1d4 +2
tums; if the snakes are not torpid, but are not
amused and angry, the chan"n lasts 1d3 turns;
if the snakes are angry or attacking, the
snake charm spell lasts 1d-1+4 rounds. The
priest casting the spell can charm snakes
whose total hit points are less than or equal
to those of the priest. On the average, a 1st-
level priest could charm snakes with a total
of 4 or 5 hit points; a Znd-level priest could
charm 9 hit points, etc. The hit points can be
those of a single snake or those of several of
the reptiles, but the total hit points cannot ex-
ceed those of the priest casting the spell. A
23-hit point caster  a dozen 2-hit
point snakes would charm 11 of them. This
spell is also effective against any ophidian or
ophidianoid monster, such as naga, couatl,
etc., subject to magic resistance, hit points,
and so forth.
Priest Spells (2nd Level)
Variations of this spell may exist, allow-
ing other creatures significant to a particular
mythos to be affected. Your DM will inform
you if such spells exist.
Speak With Animals (Alteration)
Sphere: Animal, Divination
Range: 0
Components: V. S
Duration: 2 roundsl level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 animal within
30-foot radius of priest
Saving Throw: None
This spell empowers the priest to compre-
hend and communicate with any wan-n- or
cold~blooded nonnal or giant animal that is
not mindless. The priest is able to ask ques-
tions and receive answers of the creature, al-
though friendliness and cooperation are by
no means assured. Furthermore, terseness
and evasiveness are likely in basically wary
and cunning creatures (the more stupid ones
will instead make inane comments). if the
animal is friendly or of the same general
alignment as the priest, there is a possibility
that the animal will do some favor or service
for the priest. This possibility is determined
by the DM. Note that this spell differs from
the speak with monsters spell, for this spell
allows conversation only with nonnal or gi-
ant, non-fantastic creatures such as apes,
bears, cats, dogs, elephants, and so on.
Splrltual Hammer (Invocation)
Sphere: Combat
Range: 10 yardsl level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: S
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
By calling upon his deity, the caster of a
spiritual hammer spell brings into existence
a field of force shaped vaguely like a ham-
mer. As long as the caster concentrates upon
the hammer, it strikes at any opponent
within its range, as desired. Each round the
caster can choose to attack the same target
as the previous round or switch to a new tar-
get that he can see anywhere Within his max-
imum range. The spiritual hammer's chance
to successfully hit is equal to that of the
caster, without any Strength bonuses. ln ad-
dition, it strikes as a magical weapon with a
bonus of +1 for every six experience levels
(or fraction) of the spellcaster, up to a total
of +3 to the attack roll and +3 to the dam-
age roll for a 13th-level caster. The base
damage inflicted when it scores a hit is ex-
actly the same as a normal war hammer
(1d4 4' 1 vs. opponents of man size or
smaller, 1d4 upon larger opponents, plus
the magical bonus). The hammer strikes in
201
the same direction as the caster is facing, so
if he is behind the target, all bonuses for rear
attack are gained along with the loss of any
modifications to the target's AC for shield
and Dexterity.
As soon as the caster ceases concentra-
tion, the spirilunl hammer spell ends. A dis-
pel magic spell that includes either the caster
or the force in its area of effect has a chance
to dispel the spiritual hammer. if an at-
tacked creature has magic resistance, the re-
sistance is checked the first time the spiritual
hammer strikes. If the hammer is success-
fully resisted, the spell is lost. lf not, the
hammer has its normal full effect for the du-
ration of the spell.
The material component of this spell is a
normal war hammer that the priest must
hurl toward opponents while uttering a plea
to his deity. The hammer disappears when
the spell is cast.
Trlp (Enchantment/Chann)
Sphere: Plant
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 tuml level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 object up to 10 feet long
Saving Throw: Neg.
This magic must be cast upon a normal
object—a length of vine. a stick, a pole, a
rope, or a similar object. The spell causes
the object to rise slightly off the ground or
ﬂoor it is resting on to trip most creatures
crossing it, if they fail their saving throws
vs. spell. Note that only as many creatures
can be tripped as are actually stepping
across the enchanted obiect. Thus a three-
foot-long piece of rope could trip only one
man-sized creature. Creatures moving at a
very rapid pace (nmning) when tripped suf-
fer 1 point of damage and are stunned for
1d4 + 1 rounds if the surface they fall upon is
very hard (if it is turf or other soft material,
they are merely stunned for the rest of that
round). Very large creatures, such as ele-
phants. are not at all affected by a trip. The
object continues to trip all creatures passing
over it, including the spellcaster, for as long
as the spell duration lasts. A creature aware
of the object and its potential adds a +4 bo-
nus to its saving throw roll when crossing
the object. The enchanted object is 80% un-
detectable unless a means that detects magi-
cal traps is employed or the operation of the
spell is observed. This spell does not func-
tion under water.



% Priest Spells (3rd level)
Warp Wood (Alteration)
Reversible
Sphere: Plant
Range: 10 yards/level
Components: V, S
Duration: Pemtanent
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special
When this spell is cast, the priest causes a
volume of wood to bend and warp, penna-
nently destroying its straightness, form, and
strength. The range of a warp wood spell is
10 yards for each level of experience of the
caster. lt affects approximately a 15-inch
shaft of wood of up to one-inch diameter
per level of the caster. Thus. at 1st level, a
caster might be able to warp an hand axe
handle or four crossbow bolts; at 5th level.
he could warp the shaft of a typical spear.
Note that boards or planks can also be af-
fected, causing a door to be sprung or a boat
or ship to leak. Warped missile weapons are
useless; warped melee weapons suffer a -4
penalty to their attack rolls.
Enchanted wood is affected only if the
spellcaster is of higher level than the caster
of the prior enchantment. The spellcaster
has a 20% cumulative chance of success per
level of difference (20% if one level higher,
40% if two levels higher, etc.). Thus, a door
magically held or wizard locked by a 5th-
level wizard is 40% likely to be affected by a
warp wood spell cast by a 7th-level priest.
Wooden magical items are considered en-
chanted at 12th level (or better). Brtremely
powerful items, such as artifacts, are unaf-
fected by this spell.
The reversed spell. straighten wood,
straightens bent or crooked wood, or re-
verses the effects of a warp wood spell, sub-
iect to the same restrictions.
Withdraw (Alterationl
Sphere: Protection
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
By means of a withdraw spell, the priest
in effect alters the flow of time with regard
to himself. While but one round of time
passes for those not affected by the spell, the
priest is able to spend two rounds, plus one
round per level. in contemplation. Thus, a
5th-level priest can withdraw for seven
rounds to cogitate on some matter while one
round passes for all others. (The DM should
allow the player one minute of real time per
l'OLll'\d withdrawn to ponder some problem
or question. No discussion with other play-
ers is permitted.) Note that while affected
by the withdraw spell, the caster can use
only the following spells: any divination
spell or any curing or healing spell, the latter
on himself only. The casting of any of these
spells in a different fashion (e.g., a cure light
wounds spell bestowed upon a companion)
negates the withdraw spell. Similarly, the
withdrawn caster cannot walk or run, be-
come invisible, or engage in actions other
than thinking, reading. and the like. He can
be affected by the actions of others, losing
any Dexterity or shield bonus. Any success-
ful attack upon the caster breaks the spell.
Wyvem Watch (Evoration)
Sphere: Guardian
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 8 hours or until strike
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 10-foot-radius sphere
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell is known as wyvem watch be-
cause of the insubstantial haze brought
forth by its casting. which vaguely resem-
bles a wyvern. lt is typically used to guard
some area against intrusion. Any creature
approaching within 10 feet of the guarded
area may be affected by the “wyvem." Any
creature entering the guarded area must roll
a successful saving throw vs. spell or stand
paralyzed for one round per level of the
caster, until freed by the spellcaster, by a
dispel magic spell, or by a remove paralysis
spell. A successful saving throw indicates
that the subject creature was missed by the
attack of the wyvem-form, and the spell re-
mains in place. As soon as a subject creature
is successfully struck by the wyvem-forrn,
the paralysis takes effect and the force of the
spell dissipates. The spell force likewise dis-
sipates if no intruder is struck by the
wyvem-form for eight hours after the spell
is cast. Any creature approaching the space
being guarded by the wyvem-form may be
able to detect its presence before coming
close enough to be attacked; this chance of
detection is 90% in bright light, 30% in twi-
light conditions, and 0% in darkness.
The material component is the priest's
holy symbol.

Third-level Spells
Animate Dead (Necromancy)
Sphere: Necromantic
Range: 10 yards
Components: V. S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell creates the lowest of the undead
monsters, skeletons or zombies, usually
from the bones or bodies of dead humans,
demihumans. or humanoids. The spell
causes these remains to become animated
and obey the simple verbal commands of
the caster, regardless of how they communi-
cated in life. The skeletons or zombies can
follow the caster, remain in an area and at-
tack any creature (or iust a specific type of
creature) entering the place, etc. The un-
dead remain animated until they are de-
stroyed in combat or are turned; the magic
cannot be dispelled.
The priest can animate one skeleton or
one zombie for each experience level he has
attained. lf creatures with more than 1 + Hit
Dice are animated. the number is deter-
mined by the monster Hit Dice. Skeletal
fonrts have the Hit Dice of the original crea-
ture, while zombie forms have 1 more Hit
Die. Thus, a 12th-level priest could animate
12 dwarven skeletons (or six zombies). four
zombie gnolls, or a single zombie fire giant.
Note that this is based on the standard racial
Hit Die norm; thus, a high—level adventurer
would be animated as a skeleton or zombie
of 1 or 2 Hit Dice, and without special class
or racial abilities. The caster can, alterna-
tively, animate two small animal skeletons
(1-1 Hit Die or less) for every level of experi-
ence he has achieved.
The spell requires a drop of blood, a piece
of ﬂesh of the type of ueature being ani-
mated, and a pinch of bone powder or a
bone shard to complete the spell. Casting



this spell is not a good act, and only evil
priests use it frequently.
Call Lightning (Alteration)
Sphere: Weather
Range: 0
Components: V. S
Duration: 1 tum! level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: 360-foot radius
Saving Throw: 1/1
When a call lightning spell is cast, there
must be a storm of some sort in the area-a
rain shower, clouds and wind, hot and
cloudy conditions, or even a tornado
(including a whirlwind formed by a diinn or
air elemental of 7 Hit Dice or more). The
caster is then able to call down bolts of light-
ning. The caster can call down one bolt per
turn. The caster need not calla bolt of light-
ning immediately—other actions, even
spellcasting, can be performed; however,
the caster must remain stationary and con-
centrate for a full round each time a bolt is
called. The spell has a duration of one turn
per caster level. Each bolt causes 2dB points
of electrical damage, plus an additional 1d8
points for each of the caster’s experience
levels. Thus, a 4th-level caster calls down a
6d8 bolt (2d8 + 4d8).
The bolt of lightning ﬂashes down in a
vertical stroke at whatever distance the
spellmster decides, up to 360 yards away.
Any creature within a 10-foot radius of the
path or the point where the lightning strikes
suffers full damage unless a successful sav-
ing throw vs. spell is rolled, in which case
only onehalf damage is taken.
Because it requires a storm overhead, this
spell can only be used outdoors. lt does not
function under ground or under water.
Continual light (Alteration)
Reversible
Sphere: Sun
Range: 120 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 60-foot-radius globe
Saving Throw: Special
This spell is similar to a light spell, except
that it is as bright as full daylight and lasts
until negated by magical darkness or by a
dispel magic spell. Creatures with penalties
in bright light suffer them in this spel|'s area
of effect. As with the light spell, this can be
cast into air, onto an object, or at a creature.
ln the third case, the continual light affects
the space about one foot behind a creature
that successfully rolls its saving throw vs.
spell (a failed saving throw means the con-
tinual light is centered on the creahire and
Priest Spells (3rd Level) T
moves as it moves). Note that this spell also
blinds a creature if it is successfully cast
upon the creature's visual organs. lf the spell
is cast on a small object that is then placed in
a light-proof covering, the spell effects are
blocked until the covering is removed.
Continual light brought into an area of
magical darkness (or vice versa) cancels the
darkness so that the otherwise prevailing
light conditions exist in the overlapping
areas of effect. A direct casting of a contin-
ual light spell against a similar or weaker
magical darkness cancels both.
This spell eventually consumes the mate-
rial it is cast upon, but the process takes far
longer than the time in a typical campaign.
Extremely hard and expensive materials
might last hundreds or even thousands of
years.
The reverse spell, continual darkness,
causes complete absence of light (pitch
blackness), similar to the dark-ness spell but
of greater duration and area.
Create food 8. Water (Alteration)
Sphere: Creation
Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: 1 cubic foot/level
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, the priest causes
food and water to appear. The food thus
aeated is highly nourishing if rather bland;
each cubic foot of the material sustains three
human-sized creatures or one horse-sized
creature for a fu.ll day. The food decays and
becomes inedible within 24 hours, although
it can be restored for another 24 hours by
casting a purify food and water spell upon
it. The water created by this spell is the same
as that created by the 1st-level priest spell
create water. For each experience level the
priest has attained, one cubic foot of food or
water is created by the spell. A Znd-level
priest could ueate one cubic foot of food
and one cubic foot of water.
Cure Blindness or Deafness
(Abiurationl
Reversible
Sphere: Neaomantic
Range: Touch
Components: V, 5
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Special
By touching the creature afflicted, the
priest employing the spell can permanently
cure some forms of blindness or deafness.
This spell does not restore or repair visual or
109
auditory organs damaged by injury or dis-
ease.
its reverse, cause blindness or deafness,
requires a successful touch (successful
attack roll) on the victim. If the victim rolls
a successful saving throw, the effect is
negated. If the saving throw is failed, a non-
damaging magical blindness or deafness
results.
A deafened creature suffers a - 1 penalty
to surprise rolls, a +1 penalty to its initia-
tive rolls, a 20% ciu-ince of spell failure for
spells with verbal components, and can
react only to what it can see or feel. A blind-
ed creature suffers a -4 penalty to its attack
rolls, a +4 penalty to its Armor Class, and a
*2 penalty to its initiative rolls.
Cure Disease (Abiuration)
Reversible
Sphere: Necromantic
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the caster to cure most
diseases by placing his hand upon the dis-
eased creature. The affliction rapidly disap-
pears thereafter, making the cured creature
whole and well in from one turn to 10 days,
depending on the type of disease and the
state of its advancement when the cure took
place. (The DM must adjudicate these con-
ditions.) The spell is also effective against
parasitic monsters such as green slime, rot
grubs, and others. When cast by a priest of
at least 12th level, this spell cures lycant.hro-
py if cast within three days of the infection.
Note that the spell does not prevent reoccur-
renoe of a disease if the recipient is again
exposed.
The reverse of the cure disease spell is
cause disease. To be effective, the priest
must touch the intended victim, and the vic-
tim must fail a saving throw vs. spell. The
severity of the disease is decided by the
priest (debilitating or fatal). The exact
details of the disease are decided by the DM,
but the following are typical:
' DebiIr'tating—The disease takes effect in
ldb turns, after which the creature loses 1
point of Strength per hour until his Strength
is reduced to 2 or less, at which time the
recipient is weak and virtually helpless. If a
creature has no Strength rating, it loses 10%
of its hit points per Strength loss, down to
10% of its original hit points. lf the disease
also affects hit points, use the more severe
penalty. Recovery requires a period of 1d3
weeks.
' Fatal—This wasting disease is effective
immediately. lnfectcd creatures receive no
benefit from cure wound spells while the



F? Priest Spells (3rd level)
disease is in effect; wounds heal at only 10%
of the natural rate. The disease proves fatal
within ldé months and can be cured only by
magical means. Each month the disease pro-
gresses, the creature loses 2 points of Cha-
risma. permanently.
The inﬂicted disease can be cured by the
cure disease spell. Lycanthropy cannot be
caused.
Dispel Magic (Abjuration)
Sphere: Protection
Range: 60 yards
Components: V. S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 30-foot cube or I item
Saving Throw: None
When a priest casts this spell, it has a
chance to neutralize or negate the magic it
comes in contact with as follows:
First, it has a chance to remove spells and
spell-like effects (including device effects
and innate abilities) from creatures or
objects. Second, it may disnipt the casting
or use of these in the area of effect at the
instant the dispel is cast. Third, it may
destroy magical potions (which are treated
as 12th level for purposes of this spell).
Each effect or potion in the spell's area is
checked to determine if it is dispelled. The
caster can always dispel his own magic; oth-
erwise the chance depends on the difference
in level between the magical effect and the
caster. The base chance of successfully dis-
pelling is 11 or higher on ldZ0. lf the caster
is higher level than the creator of the effect
to be dispelled, the difference is subtracted
from this base number needed. lf the caster
is lower level, then the difference is added to
the base. A die roll of Z0 always succeeds
and a die roll of 1 always fails. Thus, if a
caster is 10 levels higher than the magic he is
trying to dispel. only a roll of 1 prevents the
effect from being dispelled.
A dispel magic can affect only a specially
enchanted item (such as a magical scroll,
ring, wand. rod, staff, miscellaneous item.
weapon, shield, or armor) if it is cast
directly upon the item. This renders the item
nonoperational for 1d4 rounds. An item
poss&ed or carried by a creature has the
creature's saving throw against this effect;
otherwise it is automatically rendered non-
operational. An interdimensional interface
(such as a bag of holding) rendered non-
operational is temporarily closed. Note that
an item's physical properties are unchanged:
a nonoperational magical sword is still a
sword.
Artifacts and relics are not subject to this
spell, but some of their spell-like effects may
be. at the DM's option.

Felgn Death (Necromancy)
Sphere: Necromantic
Range: Touch
Component: V
Duration: 1 tum + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1/z
Area of Effect: Person touched
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the caster or any
other willing person can be put into a cata-
leptic state that is impossible to distinguish
from actual death. Although the person
affected can smell, hear, and know what is
going on, no feeling or sight of any sort is
possible; thus, any wounding or mistreat-
ment of the body is not felt, no reaction
occurs, and damage is only onehalf nor-
mal. ln addition, paralysis, poison, or
energy level drain does not affect a person
under the inﬂuence of this spell, but poison
injected or otherwise introduced into the
body becomes effective when the spell recip-
ient is no longer under the influence of this
spell, although a saving throw is permitted.
However, the spell offers no protection
from causes of certain death——being crushed
under a landslide, etc. Only a willing indi-
vidual can be affected by a feign death spell.
The priest is able to end the spell effect at
any time. but it requires a full round for
bodily functions to begin again.
Note that, unlike the wizard version of
this spell, only people can be affected, and
that those of any level can be affected by the
priest casting this spell.

Flame Walk (Alteration)
Sphere: Elemental (Fire)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round + 1/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Creature(s) touched
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the caster
empowers one or more creatures to with-
stand nonmagical fires of temperatures up
to 2.000° F. (enabling them to walk upon
molten lava). It also confers a +2 bonus to
saving throws against magical fire and
reduces damage from such fires by one-half,
even if the saving throw is failed. For every
experience level above the minimum
required to cast the spell (5th), the priest can
affect an additional creature. This spell is
not cumulative with resist fire spells or simi-
lar protections.
The material components of the spell are
the priests holy symbol and at least 500 gp
of powdered ruby per affected creature.
Glyph of Wardlng
(Abjuration, Evocation)
Sphere: Guardian
Range: Touch
Components: V, 5, M
Duration: Permanent until discharged
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special
A glyph of warding is a powerful inscrip-
tion magically drawn to prevent unauthor-
ized or hostile creatures from passing.
entering, or opening. lt can be used to guard
a small bridge, to ward an entry, or as a trap
on a chest or box.
The priest rnust set the conditions of the
ward; typically any creature violating the
warded area without speaking the name of
the glyph is subject to the magic it stores. A
successful saving throw vs. spell enables the
creature to escape the effects of the glyph.
Glyphs can be set according to physical
characteristics, such as creature type, size,
and weight. Glyphs can also be set with
respect to good or evil, or to pass those of
the caster's religion. They cannot be set



according to class, Hit Dice, or level. Multi-
ple glyphs cannot be cast on the same area:
although if a cabinet had three drawers.
each could be separately warded.
When the spell is cast, the priest weaves a
tracery of faintly glowing litres around the
warding sigil. For every five square feet of
area to be protected, one round is required
to trace the warding lines of the glyph. The
caster can affect an area equal to a square
the sides of which are the same as his level,
in feet. The glyph can be placed to conform
to any shape up to the limitations of the
caster"s total square footage. Thus a 6th-
level caster could place a glyph on a 6' x 6'
square, shape it into a rectangle 4' x 9', a
band 2’ by 18'. or a single strip 1' by 36'.
When the spell is completed, the glyph and
tracery become invisible.
The priest traces the glyph with incense,
which, if the area exceeds 50 square feet.
must be sprinkled with powdered diamond
(at least 2,000 gp worth).
Typical glyphs shock for 1d4 points of
electrical damage per level of the spellcaster,
explode for a like amount of fire damage.
paralyze, blind. deafen, and so forth. The
DM may allow any harmful priest spell
effect to be used as a glyph, provided the
caster is of sufficient level to cast the spell.
Successful saving throws either reduce
effects by one-half or negate them, accord-
ing to the glyph employed. Glyphs cannot
be affected or bypassed by such means as
physical or magical probing, though they
can be dispelled by magic and foiled by
high-level thieves using their find-and-
remove-traps skill.
The DM may decide that the exact glyphs
available to a priest depend on his religion,
and he might make new glyphs available
according to the magical research rules.
Hold Anlmal (Enchantment/Chamrl
Sphere: Animal
Range: 80 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 to 4 animals in a
40-foot cube
Saving Throw: Neg.
By means of this spell, the caster holds
one to four animals rigid. Animals affected
are normal or giant-sized mammals, birds,
or reptiles, but not monsters such as cen-
taurs, gorgons. harpies, rtaga, etc. Apes,
bears. crocodiles, dogs, eagles, foxes, giant
beavers, and similar animals are subject to
this spell. The hold lasts for two rounds per
caster level. The caster decides how many
animals can be affected, but the greater the
number, the better chance each has to suc-
cessfully save against the spell. Each animal
gets a saving throw: if only one is the subject
Priest Spells (3rd Level) i‘
of the spell, it has a penalty of -4 to its roll;
if two are subject. each receives a penalty of
-2 to its roll; if three are subject, each
receives a penalty of -1 to its roll: if four
are subject, each gets an unmodified saving
throw.
A maximum body weight of 400 pounds
(100 pounds for nonmammals) per animal
per caster level can be affected—e.g., an
8th-level caster can affect up to four 3,200-
pound mammals or a like number of 800-
pound nonmammals, such as birds or
reptiles.
Locate Object (Divination)
Reversible
Sphere: Divination
Range: 60 yards + 10 yd./ level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 1 tum
Area of Effect: 1 object
Saving Throw: None
This spell helps locate a known or famil-
iar object. The priest casts the spell, slowly
turns, and will sense when he is facing in the
direction of the object to be located, provid-
ed the object is within range—e.g., 90 yards
for 3rd-level priests, 100 yards for 4th, 110
yards for 5th, etc. The spell locates such
objects as apparel, jewelry, furniture, tools,
weapons, or even a ladder or staimay.
Once the caster has fixed in his mind the
item sought, the spell locates only that item.
Attempting to find a specific item. such as a
kingdom's crown, requires an accurate men-
tal image. If the image is not close enough to
the actual item, the spell does not work; in
short, desired but unique objects cannot be
located by this spell unless they are known
by the caster. The spell is blocked by lead.
The casting requires the use of a piece of
lodestone.
The reversal, obscure object, hides an
object from location by spell, crystal ball,
or similar means for eight hours. The caster
must touch the object being concealed.
Neither application of the spell affects liv-
ing creatures.
Magical Vestrnent (Enchantment)
Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 5 roundsl level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
This spell enchants the casters vestment,
providing protection at least the equivalent
of chain mail (AC 5). The vestment gains a
4' I enchantment for each three levels of the
priest beyond Sth level, to a maximum of
ZII
AC 1 at 17th level. The magic lasts for five
rounds per level of the caster. or until the
caster loses consciousness. lf the vestment is
worn with other armors, only the best AC
(either the armor or the vestment) is used—
this protection is not cumulative with any
other AC protection.
The material components are the vest-
ment to be enchanted and the priest's holy
symbol, which are not expended.
Meld Into Stone (Alteration)
Sphere: Elemental (Earth)
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 8 rounds + 1d8 rounds
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the priest to meld his
body and possessions into a single block of
stone. The stone must be large enough to
accommodate his body in all three dimen-
sions. When casting is complete, the priest
and not more than 100 pounds of nonliving
gear merge with the stone. lf either condi-
tion is violated, the spell fails and is wasted.
While in the stone, the priest remains in
contact, however tenuous, with the face of
the stone through which he melded. The
priest remains aware of the passage of time.
Nothing that goes on outside the stone can
be seen or heard, however. Minor physical
damage to the stone does not harm the
priest, but its partial destruction, if enough
so that the caster no longer fits, expels the
priest with 4d8 points of damage. The
stone's destruction expels the priest and
slays him instantly, unless a successful sav-
ing throw vs. spell is rolled.
The magic lasts for 1d8+8 rounds, the
variable part of the duration rolled secretly
by the DM. At any time before the duration
expires, the priest can step out of the stone
through the stone surface he entered. If the
duration nms out, or the effect is dispelled
before the priest exits the stone, then he is
violently expelled and suffers 4d8 points of
damage.
The following spells harm the priest if
cast upon the stone that he is occupying:
stone to flesh expels the priest and inﬂicts
4d8 points of damage; stone shape causes
4d4 points of damage, but does not expel the
priest: tnmsmute rock to mud expels and
slays him instantly unless he rolls a success-
ful saving throw vs. spell; pnsswall expels
the priest without damage.



i‘ Priest Spells (3rd Level)
Negative Plane Protection
(Abluretion)
Sphere: Protection. Necromantic
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
This spell affords the caster or touched
creature partial protection from undead
monsters with Negative Material plane con-
nections (such as shadows, wights, wraiths,
spectres, or vampires) and certain weapons
and spells that drain energy levels. The neg-
ative plane protection spell opens a channel
to the Positive Material plane, possibly off-
setting the effect of the negative energy
attack. A protected creature struck by a
negative energy attack is allowed a saving
throw vs. death magic. lf successful, the
energies cancel with a bright ﬂash of light
and a thunderclap. The protected creature
suffers only normal hit point damage from
the attack and does not suffer any drain of
experience or Strength, regardless of the
number of levels the attack would have
drained. An attacking undead creature suf-
fers Zd6 points of damage from the Positive
plane energy; a draining wizard or weapon
receives no damage.
This protection is proof against only one
such attack, dissipating immediately wheth-
er or not the saving throw was successful. lf
the saving throw is failed, the spell recipient
suffers double the usual physical damage, in
addition to the loss of experience or
Strength that nonnaily occurs. The protec-
tion lasts for one turn per level of the priest
casting the spell, or until the protected crea-
ture is struck by a negative energy attack.
This spell cannot be cast on the Negative
Material plane.
Plant Growth (Alteration)
Sphere: Plant
Range: 160 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Pennanent
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special
The plant growth spell enables the caster
to choose either of two different uses. The
first causes normal vegetation to grow,
entwine, and entangle to form a thicket or
jungle that creatures must hack or force a
way through at a movement rate of 10 feet
per round (or Z0 feet per round for larger-
than-man-sized creatures). Note that the
area must have brush and trees in it in order
for this spell to take effect. Briars, bushes.
creepers, lianas, roots, saplings, thistles,
thorn, trees, vines, and weeds become so
thick and overgrown in the area of effect as
to fonn a barrier. The area of effect is a
square 20 feet on a side per level of experi-
ence of the caster, in any square or rectangu-
lar shape that the caster decides upon at the
time of the spellcasting. Thus an 8th~level
caster can affect a maximum area of 160'
X 160' square, a 320' X 80' rectangle, a
640' X 40‘ rectangle, a 1,280’ X 20‘ rec-
tangle, etc. The spell's effects persist in the
area until it is cleared by labor, fire, or such
magical means as a dispel magic spell.
The second use of the spell affects a one-
rnile square area. The DM secretly makes a
saving throw (based on the caster's level) to
see if the spell takes effect. lf successful, the
spell renders plants more vigorous, fruitful,
and hardy, increasing yields by 20% to 50%
(l1d4 +1] X 10%), given a normal growing
season. The spell does not prevent disaster
in the fon-n of floods, drought, fire, or
insects, although even in these cases the
plants survive better than expected. This
effect lasts only for the life cycle of one sea-
son, the winter "death" marking the end of a
life cycle even for the sturcliest of trees. ln
many farming communities, this spell is
normally cast at planting time as part of the
spring festivals.
Prayer (ConlurationISurnrnorrlng)
Sphere: Combat
Range: 0
Components: \/, S. M
Duration: 1 roundl level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 60-foot radius
Saving Throw: None
By means of the prayer spell, the priest
brings special favor upon himself and his
party and causes harm to his enemies.
Those in the area at the instant the spell is
completed are affected for the duration of
the spell. When the spell is completed, all
attack and damage rolls and saving throws
made by those in the area of effect who are
friendly to the priest gain +1 bonuses.
while those of the priest's enemies suffer - 1
penalties. Once the prayer spell is uttered,
the priest can do other things, unlike a
chant, which he must continue to make the
spell effective. if another priest of the same
religious persuasion (not merely the same
alignment) is chanting when a prayer is cast.
the effects combine to 4-2 and -2, as long
as both are in effect at once.
The priest needs a silver holy symbol,
prayer beads, or a similar device as the
material component of this spell.
Zll
Protection from Fire (Ablru-rition)
Sphere: Protection. Elemental (Fire)
Range: Touch
Components: V. S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
The effect of a protection from fire spell
differs according to the recipient of the
magic—either the caster or some other crea-
ture. ln either case, the spell lasts no longer
than one turn per caster level.
' if the spell is cast upon the caster, it confers
complete invulnerability to normal fires
(torches, bonfires, oil fires, and the like) and
to exposure to magical fires such as fiery
dragon breath, spells such as bumirrg
hands, ﬁreball. fire seeds, ﬁre storm, ﬂame
strike, meteor swnrrn. hell hound or pyro-
hydra breath, etc., until the spell has
absorbed 12 points of heat or fire damage
per level of the caster, at which time the spell
is negated.
' if the spell is cast upon another creature, it
gives invulnerability to normal fire, gives a
bonus of +4 to saving throw die rolls vs.
fire attacks, and it reduces damage sus-
tained from magical ﬁres by 50%.
The caster's holy symbol is the material
component.
Pyrotechnics (Alteration)
Sphere: Elemental (Fire)
Range: 160 yards
Components: V, 5, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 10 or 100 times
a single fire source
Saving Throw: Special
A pyrotechnics spell draws on an existing
fire source to produce either of two effects,
at the option of the caster.
' First, it can produce a flashing and fiery
burst of glowing, colored aerial fireworks
that lasts one round. This effect temporarily
blinds those creatures in, under, or within
120 feet of the area that also have an unob-
stnrcted line of sight to the effect, for 1d4 +1
rounds unless the creatures roll successful
saving throws vs. spell. The fireworks fill a
volume ten times greater than the original
fire source.
' Second, it can cause a thick, writhing
stream of smoke to arise from the source
and form a choking cloud that lasts for one
round per experience level of the caster. This
covers a roughly hemispherical volume
from the ground or floor up (or conforming
to the shape of a confined area) that totally
obscures vision beyond two feet. The smoke



fills a volume 100 times that of the fire
source.
The spell uses one fire source within the
area of effect, which is immediately extin-
guished. An extremely large fire can be used
as the source, and it is only partially extin-
guished by the casting. Magical fires are not
extinguished, although a fire-based creature
(such as a fire elemental) used as a source
suffers 1d4 points of damage, plus 1 point of
damage per caster level. This spell does not
function under water.
ltelnove Curse (Abiuration)
Reversible
Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special
Upon casting this spell, the priest is usu-
ally able to remove a curse on an object, on
a person, or in the form of some undesired
sending or evil presence. Note that the re-
move curse spell does not remove the curse
from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of ar-
mor, for example, although the spell typi-
cally enables the person afflicted with any
such cursed item to get rid of it. Certain spe-
cial curses may not be countered by this
spell, or may be countered only by a caster
of a certain level or more. A caster of 12th
level or more can cure lycanthropy with this
spell by casting it on the animal fon-n. The
were-creature receives a saving throw vs.
spell and, if successful, the spell fails and the
priest must gain a level before attempting
the remedy on this creature again.
The reverse of the spell is not pen-nanent;
the bestow curse spell lasts for one turn for
every experience level of the priest using the
spell. The curse can have one of the follow-
ing effects (roll percentile dice): 50% of the
time it reduces one ability of the victim to 3
(the DM randomly determines which abil-
ity); 25% of the time it lowers the victim's
attack and saving throw rolls by -4: 25%
of the time it makes the victim 50% likely to
drop whatever he is holding (or do nothing,
in the case of creatures not using tools)-
roll each round.
lt is possible for a priest to devise his own
curse, and it should be similar in power to
those given here. Consult your DM. The
subject of a bestow curse spell must be
touched. If the victim is touched, a saving
throw is still applicable; if it is successful,
the effect is negated. The bestowed curse
cannot be dispelled.
Priest Spells (3rd Level) >2‘
Remove Paralysis (Ablurntion)
Sphere: Protection
Range: 10 yards/ level
Components: V, S
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1d4 creatures in a Z0‘ cube
Saving Throw: None
By the use of this spell, the priest can free
one or more creatures from the effects of
any paralyzation or from related magic
(such as a ghoul touch, or a hold or slow
spell). If the spell is cast on one creature, the
paralyzation is negated. If cast on two crea-
tures, each receives another saving throw
vs. the effect that afflicts it, with a +4 bo-
nus. lf cast on three or four creatures, each
receives another saving throw with a +2
bonus. There must be no physical or magi-
cal barrier between the caster and the crea-
tures to be affected, or the spell fails and is
wasted.
Snare (Enclrantrnent/Charm)
Sphere: Plant
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent until triggered
Casting Time: 3 rounds
Area of Effect: 2' diameter circle plus ‘ls’ per
level of the spellcaster
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the caster to make a
snare that is 90% undetectable without
magical aid. The snare can be made from
any supple vine, a thong, or a rope. When
the snare spell is cast upon it, the cord-
like object blends with its surroundings.
One end of the snare is tied in a loop that
contracts around one or more of the limbs
of any creature stepping inside the circle
(note that the head of a worm or snake
could be thus ensnared).
lf a strong and supple tree is nearby, the
snare can be fastened to it. The magic of the
spell causes the tree to bend and then
straighten when the loop is triggered, inflict-
ing 1d6 points of damage to the creature
trapped, and lifting it off the ground by the
trapped memberisl (or strangling it if the
head/neck triggered the snare). If no such
sapling or tree is available, the cord-like ob-
ject tightens upon the member(s), then
wraps around the entire creature, causing
no damage, but tightly binding it. Under
water, the cord coils back upon its anchor
point. The snare is magical, so for one hour
it is breakable only by cloud giant or greater
Strength (23); each hour thereafter. the
snare material loses magic so as to become 1
point more breakable per hour—22 after
two hours, 21 after three, Z0 after four-
until six full hours have elapsed. At that
tirne, 18 Strength will break the bonds. Af-
ZIS
ter 12 hours have elapsed, the materials of
the snare lose all magical properties and the
loop opens, freeing anything it held. The
snare can be cut with any magical weapon,
or with any edged weapon wielded with at
least a +2 attack bonus (from Strength, for
example).
The caster must have a snake skin and a
piece of sinew from a strong animal to
weave into the cord-like object from which
he will make the snare. Only the caster's
holy symbol is otherwise needed.

Priest Spells (3rd Level)
Speak Wlth Dead (Necromancy)
Sphere: Divination
Range: 1
Components: V, 5, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special
Upon casting a speak with dead spell, the
priest is able to ask several questions of a
dead creature in a set period of time and
receive answers according to the knowledge
of that creature. Of course, the priest must
be able to converse in the language that the
dead creature once used. The length of time
the creature has been dead is a factor, since
only higher level priests can converse with a
long-dead creature. The number of ques-
tions that can be answered and the length of
time in which the questions can be asked
depend on the level of experience of the
priest. Even if the casting is successful, such
creatures are as evasive as possible when
questioned. The dead tend to give extremely
brief and limited answers, often cryptic, and
to take questions literally. Furthen-nore.
their knowledge is often limited to what
they knew in life.
A dead creature of different alignment or
of higher level or Hit Dice than the caster's
level receives a saving throw vs. spell. A
dead creature that successfully saves can
refuse to answer questions, ending the spell.
At the DM's option, the casting of this spell
on a given creature might be restricted to
once per week.
The priest needs a holy symbol and burn-
ing incense in order to cast this spell upon
the body, remains, or a portion thereof. The
remains are not expended. This spell does
not function under water.

Spllte Growth (Alteration, Enchantment)
Sphere: Plant
Range: 60 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 3d4 tums + 1/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 10-foot square/level
Saving Throw: None
Wherever any type of plant growth of
moderate size or density is found, this spell
can be used. The ground-covering vegeta-
tion or roots and rootlets in the area
becomes very hard and sharply pointed. In
effect the ground cover, while appearing to
be unchanged, acts as if the area were
strewn with caltrops. ln areas of bare
ground or earthen pits, roots and rootlets
act in the same way. For each 10 feet of
movement through the area, the victim suf-
fers 2d4 points of damage. He must also roll
a saving throw vs. spell. If this saving throw
is failed, the victim's movement rate is
reduced by l/.1 from its current total (but a
creature's movement rate can never be less
than 1). This penalty lasts for 24 hours, after
which the characters normal movement
rate is regained.
Without the use of a spell such as true see-
ing, similar magical aids, or some other spe-
cial means of detection (such as detect tmps
or detect snares and pits), an area affected
by spike growth is absolutely undetectable
as such until a victim enters the area and suf-
fers damage. Even then, the creature cannot
determine the extent of the perilous area
unless some means of magical detection is
used.
The components for this spell are the
priest's holy symbol and either seven sharp
thoms or seven small twigs, each sharpened
to a point.
Starshlne (Evocation, Illusion/Phantasm)
Sphere: Sun
Range: 10 yd/level
Components: V, 5, M
Duration: 1 tum/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 10-foot squarel level
Saving Throw: None
A stnrshine spell enables the caster to
softly illuminate an area as if it were
exposed to a clear night sky filled with stars.
Regardless of the height of the open area in
which the spell is cast, the area immediately
beneath it is lit by starshine. Vision ranges
are the same as those for a bright moonlit
night—movement noted out to 100 yards;
stationary creatures seen up to 50 yards,-
general identiﬁcations made at 30 yards:
recognition at 10 yards. The spell creates
shadows and has no effect on infravision.
The area of effect actually appears to be a
night sky, but disbelief of the illusion merely
ll4
enables the disbeliever to note that the
"stars" are actually evoked lights. This spell
does not function under water.
The material components are several
stalks from an amaryllis plant (especially
Hypoxia) and several holly berries.
Stone Shape (Alteration)
Sphere: Elemental (Earth)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 3’ cube plus 1' cube/level
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the caster can form
an existing piece of stone into any shape that
suits his purposes. For example, a stone
weapon can be made, a special trapdoor
fashioned, or a crude idol sculpted. By the
same token, it enables the spellcaster to
reshape a stone door, perhaps so as to
escape imprisonment, providing the volume
of stone involved was within the limits of
the area of effect. While stone coffers can be
thus formed, stone doors made, etc., the
fineness of detail is not great. lf the shaping
has moving parts, there is a 30% chance
they do not work.
The material component of this spell is
soft clay that must be worked into roughly
the desired shape of the stone obiect, and
then touched to the stone when the spell is
uttered.
Summon Insects
(ConlurationlSum|noning)
Sphere: Animal
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
The summon insects spell attracts a cloud
or swarm of normal insects to attack the
foes of the caster. Flying insects appear 70%
of the time, while crawling insects appear
30 % of the time. The exact insects called are
bees, biting flies, hornets, or wasps, if ﬂying
insects are indicated; biting ants or pinching
beetles, if crawling insects are indicated. A
cloud of the ﬂying type, or a swarm of the
crawling sort, appears after the spell is cast.
This gathers at a point chosen by the caster,
within the spell's range, and attacks any sin-
gle creature the caster points to.
The attacked creature sustains 2 points of
damage if it does nothing but attempt to flee
or fend off the insects during the time it is
attacked; it suffers 4 points of damage per
round otherwise. lf the insects are ignored,
the victim fights with a -Z penalty to his
attack roll and a +2 penalty to his Armor



Class. lf he attempts to cast a spell, an initia-
tive roll should be made for the insects to see
if their damage occurs before the spell is
cast. if it does, the victim's concentration is
mined and the spell is lost.
The insects disperse and the spell ends if
the victim enters thick smoke or hot ﬂames.
Besides being driven off by smoke or hot
flames, the swarm might possibly be out-
run, or evaded by plunp'ng into a sufficient
body of water. if evaded, the summoned
insects can be sent against another oppo-
nent, but there will be at least a 1 round
delay while they leave the former opponent
and attack the new victim. Crawling insects
can travel only about 10 feet per round
(maximum speed over smooth ground) and
ﬂying insects travel 60 feet per round. The
caster must concentrate to maintain the
swarm; it dissipates if he moves or is dis-
turbed.
It is possible, in underground situations,
that the caster might summon 1d4 giant ants
by means of the spell, but the possibility is
only 30% unless giant ants are nearby. This
spell does not function under water.
The materials needed for this spell are the
casters holy symbol, a ﬂower petal, and a
bit of mud or wet clay.
Tree (Alteration)
Sphere: Plant
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 6 turns + 1 tum/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the caster is able to
assume the form of a small living tree or
shnib or that of a large dead tree trunk with
but a few limbs. Although the closest
inspection cannot reveal that this plant is
actually a person, and for all normal tests he
is, in fact, a tree or shrub, the caster is able
to observe all that goes on around him iust
as if he were in normal form. The Armor
Class and hit points of the plant are those of
the caster. The caster can remove the spell at
any time, instantly changing from plant to
his normal form and having full capability
for any action normally possible (including
spellcasting). Note that all clothing and gear
worn or carried change with the caster.
The material components of this spell are
the priest's holy symbol and a twig from a
tree.

Priest Spells (4th Level) 1'
Water Breathing (Alteration)
Revenible
Sphere: Elemental (Water, Air)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 hour/ level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Creature toudied
Saving Throw: None
The recipient of a water breathing spell is
able to breathe under water freely for the
duration of the spell—i,e., one hour for
each experience level of the caster. The
priest can divide the base duration between
multiple characters. Thus an 8th—level prist
can confer this ability to two characters for
four hours, four for two hours, eight for one
hour, etc., to a minimum of ‘/2 hour per
character.
The reverse, air breathing, enables water-
breathing creatures to survive comfortably
in the atmosphere for an equal duration.
Note that neither version prevents the recip-
ient creature from breathing in its natural
element.
Water Walk (Alteration)
Sphere: Elemental (Water)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 tum + 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the caster is able to
empower one or more ueatures to tread
upon any liquid as if it were firm ground;
this includes mud, quicksand, oil, running
water, and snow. The recipient's feet do not
toud: the surface of the liquid, but oval
depressions of his appropriate foot size and
two indies deep are left in the mud or snow.
The recipient's rate of movement remains
normal. If cast underwater, the recipient is
borne toward the surface.
For every level of the caster above the
minimum required to cast the spell (5th
level), he can affect another creature.
The material components for this spell are
a piece of cork and the priest's holy symbol.

Ablure (Abluration)
Sphere: Summoning
Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special
This spell can send an extraplanar crea-
ture back to its own plane of existence. The
spell fails against entities of demigod status
or greater, but their servants or minions can
be abjured. lf the ueature has a specific
(proper) name, then that must be known
and used. Any magic resistance of the sub-
iect must be overcome, or the spell fails. The
priest has a 50% chance of success (a roll of
11 or better on 1dZ0). The roll is adjusted by
the difference in level or Hit Dice between
the caster and the creature being abiured:
the number needed is decreased if the priest
has more Hit Dice and increased if the cea-
ture has more Hit Dice. If the spell is suc-
cessful, the creature is instantly hurled back
to its own plane. The affected creature must
survive a system shock check. If the crea-
ture does not have a Constitution score, the
required roll is 70% + 2%/Hit Die or level.
The caster has no control over where in the
creature’: plane the abiured creature
arrives. lf the attempt fails, the priest must
gain another level before another attempt
can be made on that particular ueature.
The spell requires the priest's holy sym-
bol, holy water, and some material inimical
to the creature.

Priest Spells (4th Level)
Animal Summoning i
(Coniuration, Summoning)
Sphere: Animal, Summoning
Range: 1 mile radius
Components: V. S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the caster calls up
to eight animals that have 4 Hit Dice or less,
of whatever sort the caster names when the
summoning is made. Only animals within
range of the caster at the time the spell is cast
will come. The caster can try three times to
summon three different types of animals—
e.g., suppose that wild dogs are first sum-
moned to no avail, then hawks are
unsuccessfully called, and finally the caster
calls for wild horses that may or may not be
within summoning range. Your DM must
detennine the chance of a summoned ani-
mal type being within the range of the spell.
The animals summoned aid the caster by
whatever means they possess, staying until
a fight is over, a specific mission is finished,
the caster is safe, he sends them away, etc.
Only normal or giant animals can be sum-
moned; fantastic animals or monsters can-
not be summoned by this spell (no
chimerae, dragons, gorgons, manticores.
etc.).
Call Woodland Beings
(Coniuration/Summoning)
Sphere: Summoning
Range; 100 yards/level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Neg.
By means of this spell, the caster is able to
summon certain woodland creatures to his
location. Naturally, this spell works only
outdoors, but not necessarily only in wood-
ed areas. The caster begins the incantation
and continues uninterrupted until some
called creature appears or two tums have
elapsed. (The verbalization and somatic
gesturing are easy, so this is not particularly
exhausting to the spellcaster.) Only one type
of the following sorts of beings can be sum-
moned by the spell. They come only if they
are within the range of the call.
The caster can call three times, for a dif-
ferent type each time. Once a call is success-
ful, no other type can be called without
another casting of the spell. (Your DM will
consult his outdoor map or base the proba-
bility of any such creature being within spell
range upon the nature of the area the caster
is in at the time of spellcasting.)
The creaturelsi called by the spell are
entitled to a saving throw vs. spell (with a
-4 penalty) to avoid the summons. Any
woodland bein§ answering the call are
favorably disposed to the spellcaster and
give whatever aid they are capable of. How-
ever, if the caller or members of the caller’s
party are of evil alignment, the creatures are
entitled to another saving throw vs. spell
(this time with a +4 bonus) when they come
within 10 yards of the caster or another evil
character with him. These beings immedi-
ately seek to escape if their saving throws
are successful. ln any event, if the caster
requests that the summoned creatures
engage in combat on his behalf, they are
required to roll a loyalty reaction check
based on the casters Charisma and what-
ever dealings he has had with them.
This spell works with respect to neutral or
good woodland creatures, as determined by
the DM. Thus the DM can freely add to or
alter the list as he sees fit.
lf the caster personally knows a certain
individual woodland being, that being can
be summoned at double the normal range. lf
this is done, then no other woodland crea-
tures are affected.
The material components of this spell are
a pine cone and eight holly berries.
if a percentage chance is given, druids
and other nature-based priests add 1% per
caster level. These chances can be used if no
other campaign information on the area is
available.

Cloak oi Bravery
(Con|urationISummoning)
Reversible
Sphere: Charm
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Neg.
The cloak of bravery spell can be cast
upon any willing creature. The protected
individual gains a bonus to his saving throw
against any form of fear encountered (but
not awe-an ability of some Lesser and
Greater Powers). When cast, the spell can
affect one to four creatures (caster's choice).
If only one is affected, the saving throw
bonus is +4. If two are affected, the bonus
is +3, and so forth, until four creatures are
protected by a +1 bonus. The magic of the
cloak of bravery spell works only once and
then the spell ends, whether or not the crea-
ture's saving throw is successful. The spell
ends after eight hours if no saving throw is
required before then.
The reverse of this spell, cloak of fear,
empowers a single creature touched to radi-
ate a personal aura of fear, at will, out to a
three-foot radius. All other characters and
creatures within this aura must roll success-
ful saving throws vs. spell or run away in
panic for 2dB rounds. Affected individuals
may or may not drop items, at the DM's
option.
The spell has no effect upon undead of
any sort. The effect can be used but once,
and the spell expires after eight hours if not
brought down earlier. Members of the recip-
ient's party are not immune to the effects of
the spell.
The material component for the cloak of
bravery spell is the feather of an eagle or
hawk. The reverse requires the tail feathers
of a vulture or chicken.
Control Temperature, I0’ Radius
(Alteration)
Sphere: Weather
Range: O
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 4 tums + 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 10-foot radius
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, the temperature
surrounding the caster can be altered by 10
degrees Fahrenheit, either upward or down-
ward, per level of experience of the spell-
caster. Thus, a 10th-level caster could raise
or lower the surrounding temperature from
1 to 100 degrees. The spell can be used to
ensure the comfort of the caster and those
with him in extreme weather conditions.



The party could stand about in shirt sleeves
during the worst blizzard (although it would
be raining on them) or make ice for their
drinks during a scorching heat wave.
The spell also provides protection from
intense normal and magical attacks. if the
extreme of temperature is beyond what
could be affected by the spell (a searing blast
of a fireball or the icy chill of a white
dragon), the spell reduces the damage
caused by 5 points for every level of the
caster. Nonnal saving throws are still
allowed, and the reduction is taken after the
saving throw is made or failed. Once struck
by such an attack, the spell immediately col-
lapses.
The material component for this spell is a
strip of willow bark (to lower temperatures)
or raspberry leaves (to raise temperatures).
Cure Serious Wounds (Necromancy)
Reversible
Sphere: Healing
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
This spell is a more potent version of the
cure light wounds spell. When laying his
hand upon a creature, the priest heals
Zd8 +1 points of wound or other injury
damage to the creature's body. This healing
cannot affect noncorporeal, nonliving, or
extraplanar creatures.
Cnuse serious wounds. the reverse of the
spell, operates similarly to the cause light
wounds spell, the victim having to be touch-
ed first. If the touch is successful, 2d8+1
points of damage are inﬂicted.
Detect Lie (Divination)
Reversible
Sphere: Divination
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 1 ueature
Saving Throw: Neg.
A priest who casts this spell is irnmedi-
ately able to determine if the subject crea-
ture deliberately and knowingly speaks a
lie. it does not reveal the truth, uncover
unintentional inaccuracies, or necessarily
reveal evasions. The subject receives a sav-
ing throw vs. spell, which is adiusted only
by the Wisdom of the caster--e.g., if the
caster has a Wisdom of 18, the subject's sav-
ing throw roll is reduced by 4 (see Table 5).
The material component for the detect lie
spell is one gp worth of gold dust.
Priest Spells (4th Level) ii
The spell's reverse, undetectable lie, pre-
vents the magical detection of lies spoken by
the creature for Z4 hours.
The reverse requires brass dust as its
material component.
Divination (Divination)
Sphere: Divination
Range: O
Components: V. S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 tum
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
A divination spell is used to gamer a use-
ful piece of advice conceming a specific
goal, event, or activity that will occur with-
in a one-week period. This can be as simple
as a short phrase, or it might take the form
of a cryptic rhyme or omen. Unlike the
zzugury spell, this gives a specific piece of
advice. For example, if the question is "Will
we do well if we venture to the third level?"
and a terrible troll guarding 10,000 gp and a
shield +1 lurks near the entrance to the
level (the DM estimates the party could beat
the troll after a hard fight) the divination
response might be: "Ready oil and open
ﬂame light your way to wealth." in all cases.
the DM controls what information is
received and whether additional divinations
will supply additional information. Note
that if the information is not acted upon. the
conditions probably change so that the
information is no longer useful (in the exam-
ple, the troll might move away and take the
treasure with it).
The base chance for a correct divination
is 60% , plus 1 % for each experience level of
the priest casting the spell. The DM makes
adjustments to this base chance considering
the actions being divined (if, for example,
unusual precautions against the spell have
been taken) . lf the dice roll is failed, the cast-
er knows the spell failed, unless specific
magic yielding false information is at work.
The material components of the divina-
tion spell are a sacrificial offering, incense,
and the holy symbol of the priest. if an
unusually important divination is attempt-
ed, sacrifice of particularly valuable gems,
jewelry, or magical items may be required.
Free Action (Ab]uration, Enchantment)
Sphere: Charm
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 tuml level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the creature touched to
move and attack normally for the duration
of the spell. even under the influence of
ZI1
magic that impedes movement (such as web
or slow spells) or while under water. it even
negates or prevents the effects of paralysis
and hold spells. Under water, the individual
moves at normal (surface) speed and inflicts
full damage, even with such cutting weap-
ons as axes and swords and with such
smashing weapons as flails, hammers, and
maces, provided that the weapon is wielded
in the hand rather than hurled. The free
action spell does not, however, allow water
breathing without further appropriate mag-
ic.
The material component is a leather
thong, bound arotuid the ann or similar
appendage, which disintegrates when the
spell expires.
Giant insect (Alteration)
Reversible
Sphere: Animal
Range: 20 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 1 to 6 insects
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the priest can turn
one or more normal-sized insects into larger
fon-ns resembling the giant insects described
in the Monstrous Compendium. Only one
type of insect can be altered at one time (i.e.,
a single casting cannot affect both an ant
and a fly) and all insects affected must be
groum to the same size. The number of
insects and the size to which they can be
grown depend upon the priest's level:
Priest's Insect Maximum
Level Hit Dice Total HD
7-9 3 9
10-12 4 12
13 + 6 15
For example, an 8th-level priest can grow
three insects to 3 Hit Dice, four insects to 2
Hit Dice, or nine insects to 1 hit die. Flying
insects of 3 Hit Dice or more can carry a
rider of human size (assume that such can
carry 80 pounds per Hit Die).
lf the casting is interrupted for any rea-
son, or if the insects are currently subject to
any other magical effect (including this
one), the insects die and the spell is mined.
The DM decides how many normal insects
of what type are available; this is often a
greater limitation on the spell than the limits
above.
if the insect created by this spell matches
an existing monster description, use the
monster description. Otherwise. unless the
DM creates a spedal description, the giant
fon-n has an Armor Class of between 8 and
4, one attack. and inflicts 1cl4 points of
damage per Hit Die.



Priest Spells (4th Level)
Example: A 14th-level priest uses the gi-
ant insect spell to enlarge one beetle (all that
is available) to 6 HD size. The DM decides
the beetle has AC S and bites once for 6d4
points of damage.
Note that the spell works only on actual
insects. Arachnids, crustaceans, and other
types of small creatures are not affected.
Any giant insects created by this spell do not
attempt to harm the priest, but the priest's
control of such creatures is limited to simple
commands (“attack,” "defend," "guard," and
so forth). Orders to attack a certain creature
when it appears or guard against a particu-
lar occurrence are too complex. Unless com-
manded to do otherwise, the giant insects
attempt to attack whoever or whatever is
near them.
The reverse of the spell, shrink insect, re
duces any giant insect to normal insect size.
The number of Hit Dice affected by the
priest is subtracted from the number of Hit
Dice of the insects, and any insect reduced
to 0 Hit Dice has been shrunk. Partial
shrinking is ignored; an insect is either
shrunk or unaffected. Thus, a 9th-level
priest attacked by giant ants could shrink
three warrior ants or four worker ants to
normal insect size with no saving throw.
This spell has no effect on intelligent insect-
like creatures.
The priest must use his holy symbol for
either version of the spell.
tlalluclnatory Forest
(Illusion/Phantnml
Reversible
Sphere: Plant
Range: 80 yards
Components: V. S
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 40-foot squarel level
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, a hallucinatory
forest comes into existence. The illusionary
forest appears to be perfectly natural and is
indistinguishable from a real forest. Priests
attuned to the woodlands—as well as such
creatures as centaurs, dryads. green drag-
ons, nymphs, satyrs, and treants—
recognize the forest for what it is. All other
creatures believe it is there, and movement
and order of march are affected accordingly.
Touching the illusory growth neither affects
the magic nor reveals its nature. The hallu-
cinatory forest remains until it is magically
dispelled by a reverse of the spell or a dispel
magic spell. The area shape is either roughly
rectangular or square, in general. and at
least 40 feet deep, in whatever location the
caster desires. The forest can be of less than
maximum area if the caster wishes. One of
its edges can appear up to 80 yards away
from the caster.
Hold Plant (Enchantment/Charm)
Sphere: Plant
Range: 80 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Neg.
The hold plant spell affects vegetable
matter as follows: 1) it causes ambulatory
vegetation to cease moving; Z) it prevents
vegetable matter from entwining, grasping.
closing, or growing: 3) it prevents vegetable
matter from making any sound or move-
ment that is not caused by wind. The spell
effects apply to all fonns of vegetation. in-
cluding parasitic and fungoid types. and
those magically animated or otherwise mag-
ically empowered. lt affects such monsters
as green slime, molds of any sort, shambling
mounds, shriekers, treants, etc. The dura-
tion of a hold plant spell is one round per
level of experience of the caster. lt affects
1d4 plants in a 40' X 40' area—or a square
four to 16 yards on a side of small ground
growth such as grass or mold. If but one
plant (or four yards square) is chosen as the
target for the spell by the caster, the saving
throw of the plant (or area of plant growth)
is made with a -4 penalty to the die roll; if
two plants (or eight yards square) are the
target, saving throws suffer a -2 penalty; if
three plants (or 12 yards square) are the tar-
get, saving throws suffer a - 1 penalty; and
if the maximum of four plants (or 16 yards
square) are the target, saving throws are un-
modified.
lrnbue Wlﬂl Spell Ablllty
(Enchantment)
Sphere: Charm
Range: Touch
Components: V. S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 tum
Area of Effect: Person touched
Saving Throw: None
By the use of this spell, the priest can
transfer a limited number and selection of
his currently memorized spells, and the abil-
ity to cast them, to another person. Only
non-spellcasters (including rangers under
8th level and paladins under 9th level) can
receive this bestowal; the imbue with spell
ability enchantrnent does not function for
those belonging to spellcasting classes, for
unintelligent monsters, nor for any individ-
ual with less than 1 full Hit Die. ln addition,
the person thus imbued must have a Wise
dom score of 9 or higher. Only priest spells
of an informational or defensive nature or a
cure light wounds spell can be transferred.
Transferring any other spell type negates the
ZIB
entire attempt, including any allowable
spells that were chosen. Higher level per-
sons can receive more than one spell at the
priest's option:
Level of Recipient Spells imbued
1 One 1st-level spell
3 Two 1st-level spells
5 + Two 1st- and one
Znd-level spells
The transferred spell's variable character-
istics (range. duration, area of effect, etc.)
function according to the level of the priest
originally imbuing the spell.
A priest who casts imbue with spell abil-
ity upon another character loses the number
of 1st- and 2nd-level spells he has imbued
until the recipient uses the transferred spells
or is slain. For example, a 7th-level priest
with five 1st- and four 2nd-level spells im-
bues a 10th-level ﬁghter with a cure light
wounds spell and a slow poison spell. The
cleric now can have only four 1st-level
spells memorized until the cure is cast and
only three 2nd-level spells until the slaw
poison is cast, or until the fighter is killed. in
the meantime, the priest remains responsi-
ble to his ethos for the use to which the spell
is put.
The material components for this spell are
the priest‘s holy symbol, plus some minor
item from the recipient that is symbolic of
his profession (a lockpick for a thief, etc.).
This item, and any material component for
the imbued spell, is consumed when the im-
bue with spell ability spell is cast.
Lower Water (Alteration)
Reversible
Sphere: Elemental (Water)
Range: 120 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 tum/level
Casting Time: 1 tum
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
The lower water spell causes water or
similar fluid in the area of effect to sink
away to a minimum depth of one inch. The
depth can be lowered by up to two feet for
every experience level of the priest. The wa-
ter is lowered within a square area whose
sides are 10 feet long per caster level. Thus,
an 8th-level priest affects a volume up to 16'
X 80' X 80', a 9th-level caster affects a vol-
ume up to 18’ X 90' X 90', and so on. in
extremely large and deep bodies of water,
such as deep ocean, the spell creates a whirl-
pool that sweeps ships and similar craft
downward, putting them at risk and render-
ing them unable to leave by normal move-
ment for the duration of the spell. When
cast on water elementals and other water-
based creatures, this spell acts as a slow



spell: the creature moves at half speed and
makes half its usual number of attacks each
round. The spell has no effect on other crea-
“IP25.

similar ﬂuids to retum to their highest natu-
ral level: spring flood, high tide, etc. This
can make lords impassable, float grounded
ships, and may even sweep away bridges at
the DM's option. It negates lower water and
vice versa.
The material components of this spell are
the priest's holy (or unholy) symbol and a
pinch of dust.
Neutrallze Polson (Necr0|Ilanr.y)
Reversible
Sphere: Healing
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Creature touched or 1 cubic
foot of substance/2 levels
Saving Throw: None
By means of a neutralize poison spell, the
priest detoxifies any sort of venom in the
creature or substance touched. Note that an
opponent, such as a poisonous reptile or
snake (or even an envenomed weapon of an
opponent) unwilling to be so touched
requires the priest to roll a successful attack
in combat. This spell can prevent death in a
poisoned creature if cast before death
occurs. The effects of the spell are perma-
nent only with respect to poison existing in
the touched creature at the time of the
touch, thus creatures (and objects) that gen-
erate new poison are not permanently
detoxified.
The reversed spell, poison, likewise
requires an attack roll that succeeds, and the
victim is allowed a saving throw vs. poison.
If the latter is unsuccessful, the victim is
incapacitated and dies in one tum unless the
poison is magically neutralized or slowed.
Plant Door (Alteration)
Sphere: Plant
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
The plant door spell opens a magical portal
or passageway through tres, undergrowth,
thickets, or any similar growth—even
growth of a magical nature. The plant door
is open to the caster who cast the spell, cast-
ers of a higher level, or dryads; others must
be shown the location of the door. The door
even enables the caster to enter a solid tree
Priest Spells (4th Level) -Y‘
trunk and remain hidden there until the
spell ends. The spell also enables the passage
or hiding of any man-sized or smaller crea-
ture; hiding is subject to space consider-
ations. lf the tree is cut down or burned,
those within must leave before the tree falls
or is consumed, or else they are killed also.
The duration of the spell is one turn per level
of experience of the caster. If the caster opts
to stay within an oak, the spell lasts nine
times longer. if in an ash tree. it lasts three
times longer than normal. The path created
by the spell is up to four feet wide, eight feet
high, and 12 feet long per level of experience
of the caster. This spell does not function on
plant-based monsters—e.g.. shambling
mounds, moltk, slimes, treants, etc.
The material components for this spell are
a piece of charcoal and the caster's holy
symbol.
Produce Flre (Alteration)

Sphere: Elemental (Fire)
Range: 40 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 12-foot square
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the caster causes a
common fire of up to 12 feet per side in area.
Though it lasts but a single round, unless it
ignites additional ﬂammable material, the
fire produced by the spell inﬂicts 1d4 points
of damage plus 1 point per caster level (1d4
+ 1/level) upon creatures within its area. lt
ignites combustible materials, such as cloth,
oil, paper, parchment, wood, and the like.
so as to cause continued buming.
The reverse. quench fire, extinguishes
any normal fire (coals, oil, tallow, wax,

The material component for either ver-
sion is a paste of sulfur and wax, formed
into a ball and thrown at the target.
Protection from Evll, I0’ ladlus
(Abjuratlon)
Reversible
Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 tum/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 10-foot-radius sphere
Saving Throw: None
The globe of protection of this spell is
identical in all respects to that of a protec-
tion from evil spell, except that it encom-
passes a much larger area and its duration is
greater. The effect is centered on and moves
with the creature touched. Any protected
Z19
creature within the circle will break the
warding against enchanted/summoned
monsters if he attacks those monsters. A
creature unable to fit completely into the
area of effect (for example, a Z1-foot-tall
titan) remains partially exposed and subject
to whatever penalties the DM decides. lf
such a creature is the recipient of the spell,
the spell acts as a normal protection from
evil spell for that creature only.
The reverse, protection from good, 10'
radius, wards against good creatures.
To complete this spell, the prlst must
trace a circle 20 feet in diameter using holy
(or unholy) water and incense (or smolder-
ing dung), according to the protection from
evil spell.
Protection from Llghtnlng
(Ablurationl
Sphere: Protection, Weather
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Spedal
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
The effect of a protection from lightning
spell changes depending on who is the redp-
ient of the magic-—the caster or some other
creature. ln either case, the spell lasts no
longer than one turn per caster level.
' If the spell is cast upon the caster, it
confers complete invulnerability to electri-
cal attack such as dragon breath, or magical
lightning such as lightning bolt, shocking
grasp, storm giant, will ‘o wisp, etc., until
the spell has absorbed 10 points of electrical
damage per level of the caster, at which time
the spell is negated.
' lf the spell is cast upon another crea-
ture, it gives a bonus of + 4 to the die roll for
saving throws made vs. electrical attacks,
and it reduces the damage sustained from
such attacks by 50%.
The caster’s holy symbol is the material
component.
Reﬂecting Pool (Divination)
Sphere: Divination
Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 2 hours
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the caster to cause a
pool of normal water found in a natural set-
ting to act as a scrying device. The pool can
be of no greater diameter than two feet per
level of the caster. The effect is to create a
scrying device similar to a crystal bull. The

Priest Spells (4th Level)
scrying can extend only to those planes of
existence that are coexistent with or border
on the Prime Material plane—the inner
planes (including the para-elemental planes,
plane of Shadow, etc.). General notes on
scrying, detection by the subject, and penal-
ties for attempting to scry beyond the cast-
er's own plane are given in the DMG, as well
as a description of the crystal bull item.
The following spells can be cast through a
reﬂecting pool, with a 5% per level chance
for operating correctly: detect magic, detect
snares and pits, detect poison. Each addi-
tional detection attempt requires a round of
concentration, regardless of success. Infra-
vision, if available, operates normally
through the reﬂecting pool.
The image is nearly always hazy enough
to prevent the reading of script of any type.
The material component is the oil extract-
ed from such nuts as the hickory and the
walnut, reﬁned, and dropped in three mea-
sures upon the surface of the pool. (A mea-
sure need be no more than a single ounce of
oil.)
At the DM's option, the casting of this
spell may be limited to once per day.
Repel Insects (Abluration, Alteration)
Sphere: Animal, Protection
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 tum/ level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 10-foot radius
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, the priest creates
an invisible barrier to all sorts of insects,
and normal insects do not approach within
10 feet of the caster while the spell is in
effect. Giant insects with Hit Dice less than
1/: of the caster's experience level are also
repelled (e.g., 2 Hit Dice for 7th» to 9th-level
casters, 3 Hit Dice at 10th through 12th
level, etc.). Insects with more Hit Dice can
enter the protected area if the insect is espe-
cially aggressive and, in addition, rolls a
successful saving throw vs. spell. Those that
do sustain 1d6 points of damage from pass-
ing of the magical barrier. Note that the
spell does not in any way affect arachnids,
myriapods, and similar creatures—it affects
only true insects.
The material components of the repel
insects spell include any one of the follow-
ing: several cmshed marigold ﬂowers, a
whole crushed leek, seven crushed stinging
nettle leaves, or a small lump of resin from a
camphor tree.
Speak With Plants (Alteration)
Sphere: Plant
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round/ level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: 30-foot radius
Saving Throw: None
When cast, a speak with plants spell
enables the priest to converse, in very rudi-
mentary terms, with all sorts of living vege-
tables (including fungi, molds, and
plant-like monsters, such as shambling
mounds) and to exercise limited control
over normal plants (i.e., not monsters or
plant-like creatures). Thus, the caster can
question plants as to whether or not crea-
tures have passed through them, cause
thickets to part to enable easy passage,
require vines to entangle pursuers, and com-
mand similar services. The spell does not
enable plants to uproot themselves and
move about, but any movements within the
plants’ normal capabilities are possible.
Creatures entangled by the 1st-level spell of
that name can be released. The power of the
spell lasts for one round for each experience
level of the casting priest. All vegetation
within the area of effect is affected by the
spell.
The material components for this spell are
a drop of water, a pinch of dung, and a
ﬂame.
Spell Immunity (Abiuration)
Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 tum/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the priest renders a
creature touched immune to the effects of a
specified spell of 4th level or lower. lt pro-
tects against spells, spell~like effects of magi-
cal items, and innate spell-like abilities of
creatures. lt does not protect against breath
weapons or gaze attacks of any type. The
spell has additional limitations. First, the
caster must have directly experienced the
effect of the spell specified. For example, if
the caster has been attacked by a ﬁreball
spell at some time, then he can use spell
immunity to provide protection from a fire-
ball. Second, the spell cannot affect a crea-
ture already magically protected by a
potion, protective spell, ring, or other
device. Third, only a particular spell can be
protected against, not a certain sphere of
spells or a group of spells that are similar in
effect; thus, a creature given immunity to
the lightning boll spell is still vulnerable to a
shocking grasp spell.
Z20
The material component for spell immu-
nity is the same as that for the spell to be
protected against.
Sticks to Snakes (Alteration)
Reversible
Sphere: Plant
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Z rounds/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 1d4 sticks + 1 stick! level in a
10-foot cube
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the caster can
change 1d4 sticks, plus one stick per experi-
ence level, into snakes; thus a 9th-level
priest can change 10-13 sticks into an equal
number of snakes. These snakes attack as
commanded by the priest. There must, of
course, be sticks or similar pieces of wood
(such as torches, spears, etc.) to turn into
snakes. Such a stick cannot be larger than a
staff. Stidts held by ueatures are allowed a
saving throw equal to that of the possessor
(i.e., a spear held by an orc must fail the
orc's saving throw vs. polymorph). Magical
items, Such as slaves and enchanted spears,
are not affected by the spell. Only sticks
within the area of effect are changed. The
type of snake created varies, but a typical
specimen has 2 l-[it Dice, Armor Class 6, a
movement rate of 9, and either constricts
for 1d4+1 points of damage per round or
bites for 1 point plus poison (if any). The
diance of a snake thus changed being ven-
omous is5% per caster level, if the spellcast-
er desires. Thus, an 11th-level priest has a
maximum 55% chance that any snake cre
ated by the spell is poisonous. The spell lasts
for two rounds for each experience level of
the spellcaster.
The material components of the spell are a
small piece of bark and several snake scales.
The reverse changes normal-sized snakes
to sticks for the same duration, or it negates
the sticks to snakes spell according to the
level of the priest countering the spell (e.g.,
a 10th-level priest casting the reverse spell
can turn 11-14 snakes back into sticks).
Tongues (Alteration)
Reversible
Sphere: Divination
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 tum
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the caster to speak and
understand additional languages, whether
they are racial tongues or regional dialects,



but not communications of animals or
mindless creatures. When the spell is cast,
the spellcaster selects the language or lan-
guages to be understood. The spell then em-
powers the caster with the ability to speak
and understand the language desired with
perfect ﬂuency and accent. The spell enables
the priest to be understood by all speakers
of that language within hearing distance,
usually 60 feet. This spell does not predis-
pose the subject toward the caster in any
way. The priest can speak one additional
tongue for every three levels of experience.
The reverse of the spell cancels the effect
of the tongues spell or confuses verbal com-
munication of any sort within the area of ef-
fect.

Air Walk (Alteration)
Sphere: Elemental (Air)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 hour + 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables a creature, which can
be as large as the largest giant, to tread upon
air just as if it were solid ground. Moving
upward is similar to walking up a hill; a
maximum upward angle of 45 degrees is
possible at one-half the creature's move-
ment rate. Likewise, a maximum downward
Priest Spells (5th Level) EYE
angle of 45 degrees at the normal movement
rate is possible. An air-walking creature is
always in control of its movement rate, save
when a wind is blowing. ln this case the
creature gains or loses 10 feet of movement
for every 10 miles per hour of wind velocity.
The creature may, at the DM's option. be
subject to additional penalties, loss of con-
trol, and possible damage in exceptionally
strong or turbulent winds.
The spell can be placed upon a trained
mount, so it can be ridden through the air.
Of course, a mount not accustomed to such
movement would certainly need careful and
lengthy training, the details of which are up
to the DM.
The material components for the spell are
the priest's holy symbol and a bit of thistle-
down.
Animal Growth (Alteration)
Reversible
Sphere: Animal
Range: 80 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Up to 8 animals in a
20-foot-square area
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, the caster causes
all animals, up to a maximum of eight,
within a 20-foot-square area to grow to
twice their normal size. The effects of this
growth are doubled Hit Dice (with resultant
improvement in attack potential), doubled
hit points (except hit points added to Hit
Dice). and doubled damage in combat.
Movement and AC are not affected. The
spell lasts for two rounds for each level of
the caster. The spell is particularly useful in
conjunction with a charm person or mam-
mizl spell.
The reverse reduces animal size by one-
half, and likewise reduces Hit Dice, hit
points, attack damage, etc.
The material component for this spell and
its reverse is the caster's holy symbol and a
scrap of food.
Animal Summoning ll
(Coniuntion/Summoning)
Sphere: Animal, Summoning
Range: 60 yardsl level
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: B
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the caster calls up
to six animals that have 8 Hit Dice or less, or
12 animals of 4 Hit Dice or less, of whatever
sort the caster names. Only animals within
lli
range of the caster at the time the spell is cast
will come. The caster can try three times to
summon three different types of animals-
suppose that wild dogs are first summoned
to no avail. then hawks are unsuccessfully
called, and finally the caster calls for wild
horses that may or may not be within sum-
moning range. Your DM will detennine the
chance of a summoned animal type being
within range of the spell. The animals sum-
moned aid the caster by whatever means
they possess. staying until a fight is over, a
specific mission is finished, the caster is safe,
he sends them away, etc. Only normal or gi-
ant animals can be summoned; fantastic an-
imals or monsters cannot be summoned by
this spell (no chimerae, dragons, gorgons.
manticores, etc.).
Anti-Plant Shell (Abjuration)
Sphere: Plant, Protection
Range: 0
Components: V. S
Duration: 1 turr\/ level
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 15’ diameter hemisphere
Saving Throw: None
The imti-plant shell spell creates an invisi-
ble, mobile barrier that keeps out all crea-
tures or missiles of living vegetable
material. Thus, the caster (and any crea-
tures within the shell) is protected from at-
tacking plants or vegetable creatures such as
shambling mounds or treants. Any attempt
to force the barrier against such creatures
shatters the barrier immediately. The spell
lasts for one tum for each experience level of
the caster.
Atonement (Abhrration)
Sphere: All
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 tum
Area of Effect: 1 person
Saving Throw: None
This spell is used by the priest to remove
the burden of unwilling or unknown deeds
from the person who is the subject of the
atonement. The spell removes the effects of
magical alignment change as well. The per-
son seeking the atonement spell must either
be truly repentant or not have been in com-
mand of his own will when the acts to be
atoned for were committed. Your DM will
judge this spell in this regard, noting any
past instances of its use upon the person.
Deliberate misdeeds and acts of knowing
and willful nature cannot be atoned for with
this spell (see the quest spell). A character
who refuses to accept an atonement is auto-
matically considered to have committed a
willful misdeed.

thereof-—and request information in the
form of questions that can be answered by a
simple "yes" or "no." The priest is allowed
one such question for every experience level
he has attained. The answers given are cor-
rect within the limits of the entity's knowl-
edge ("l don't know” is a legitimate answer,
as powerful outer planar beings are not nec-
essarily omniscient). Optionally, the DM
may give a single short answer, of five
words or less. The spell will, at best, pro-
vide information to aid character decisions.
Entities communed with structure their an-
swers to further their own purposes. lt is
probable that the DM will limit the use of
commune spells to one per adventure, one
per week, or even one per month, for the
greater powers dislike frequent interrup-
tions. Likewise, if the caster lags, discusses
the answers, or goes off to do anything else.
the spell immediately ends.
The material components necessary to a
commune spell are the priest's religious sym-
bol, holy (unholy) water, and incense. lf a
particularly potent commune is needed, a
sacrifice proportionate with the difficulty of
obtaining the information is required, and if
the offering is insufficient, only partial or no
information is gained.
Commune With Nature (Divination)
Sphere: Divination
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the caster to become
one with nature in the area, thus being em-
powered with knowledge of the surround-
ing tenitory. For each level of experience of
the caster. he can "know" one fact: the
ground ahead, left or right; the plants
ahead, left or right; the minerals ahead, left
or right; the water courses/ bodies of water
ahead, left or right; the people dwelling
ahead, left or right; the general animal pop-
ulation, left or right; the presence of wood-
land creatures, left or right; etc. The
presence of powerful unnatural creatures
can also be detected, as can the general state
of the natural setting. The spell is most ef-
fective in outdoor settings, operating in a
radius of one-half mile for each level of the
caster. ln natural underground settings-
caves, cavems, etc.—the range is limited to
10 yards per caster level. ln constructed set-
tings (dungeons and towns), the spell will
not function. The DM may limit the casting
of this spell to once per month.
Control Wlnds (Alteration)
Sphere: Weather
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 tum/level
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 40-foot/level radius
Saving Throw: None
By means of a control winds spell, the
caster is able to alter wind force in the area
of effect. For every three levels of experi-
ence, the caster can increase or decrease
wind force by one level of strength. Wind
strengths are as follows:
Wind Force Miles Per Hour
Light Breeze 2-7
Moderate Breeze 8-18
Strong Breeze 19-31
Gale 32-54
Storm $5-72
Hurricane 73-176
Winds in excess of 19 miles per hour drive
small ﬂying creatures (those eagle-sized and
under) from the skies, severely affect missile
accuracy, and make sailing difficult. Winds
in excess of 32 miles per hour drive even
man-sized flying creatures from the skies
and cause minor ship damage. Winds in ex-
cess of 55 miles per hour d.rive all ﬂying
creatures from the skies, uproot trees of
small size, knock down wooden structures,
tear off roofs, etc., and endanger ships.
Winds in excess of 73 miles per hour are of
hurricane force.
An "eye" of 40-foot radius, in which the
wind is calm, exists around the caster. Note
that while the spell can be used in under-
ground places, the eye shrinks one foot for
every foot of confinement, if the spell is cast
in an area smaller than the area of effect.
(For example, if the area of effect is a 360-
foot radius, and the space only allows a 350-
foot area, the eye shrinks by 10 feet to a
30-foot radius; a space under 320 feet in ra-
dius would eliminate the eye and subject the
spellcaster to the effects of the wind.)
Once the spell is cast, the wind force in-
creases (or decreases) by 3 miles per hour
per round until the maximum (or minimum)
speed is attained. The caster, with one
round of complete concentration, can stabi-
lize the wind at its current strength, or set it
Z21
to increase or decrease, although the rate of
the change cannot be altered. The spell re-
mains in force for one turn for each level of
experience of the caster. When the spell is
exhausted, the force of the wind wanes (or
waxes) at the same rate, until it reaches the
level it was at before the spell took effect.
Another caster can use a control winds spell
to counter the effects of a like spell up to the
limits of his own ability.
Cure Critical Wounds (Necromanty)
Reversible
Sphere: Healing
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
The cure critical wounds spell is a very
potent version of the cure light wounds
spell. The priest lays his hand upon a crea-
ture and heals 3d8+3 points of damage
from wounds or other damage. The spell
does not affect creatures without corporeal
bodies, those of extraplanar origin, or those
not living.
The reversed spell, cause critical wounds.
operates in the same fashion as other cause
wounds spells, requiring a successful touch
to inflict the 3dB +3 points of damage.
Caused wounds heal via the same methods
as do wounds of other sorts.
Dispel Evll (Abluration)
Reversible
Sphere: Protection, Summoning
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round/ level
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Neg.
The priest using this spell causes a sum-
moned creature of evil nature, an evil crea-
ture from another plane, or a creature
summoned by an evil caster. to retum to its
own plane or place when the caster success-
fully strikes it in melee combat. (Examples
of such creatures are aerial servants, diinn,
efreet, elementals, and invisible stalkers.)
An evil enchantment (such as a charm spell
cast by an evil creature) that is subject to a
normal dispel magic spell can be automati-
cally dispelled by the dispel evil spell. Note
that this spell lasts for a maximum of one
round for each experience level of the caster,
or until expended. While the spell is in ef-
fect, all creatures that could be affected by it
attack with a -7 penalty to their attack
rolls when engaging the spellcaster.



The reverse of the spell, dispel good.
functions against summoned or enchanted
creatures of good alignment or creatures
that have been sent to aid the cause of good.
The material components for this spell are
the priest's religious object and holy (or un-
holy) water.
Flame Strike (Evocation)
Sphere: Combat
Range: 60 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 5-foot radius
by 30-foot-high column
Saving Throw: ‘/1
When the priest calls down a flame strike
spell, a vertical column of fire roars down-
ward in the exact location called for by the
caster. Any creature within the area of effect
of a ﬂame strike must roll a saving throw vs.
spell. Failure means the creature sustains
6cl8 points of damage; otherwise. the dam-
age is halved.
The material component of this spell is a
pinch of sulphur.
Insect Plague (Conjuration/Summoning)
Sphere: Combat
Range: 120 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 roundsl level
Casting Time: 1 tum
Area of Effect: 180' diameter, 60' high cloud
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast by the priest, a
horde of creeping, hopping, and ﬂying in-
sects gather and swarm in a thick cloud. lln
an environment free of normal insects, the
spell fails.) The insects obscure vision, limit-
ing it to 10 feet. Spellcasting within the
cloud is impossible. Creatures in the insect
plague sustain 1 point of damage for each
round they remain within, due to the bites
and stings of the insects, regardless of Ar-
mor Class. l.nvisibility is no protection. All
creatures with Z or fewer Hit Dice will auto-
matically move at their fastest possible
speed in a random direction until they are
more than 240 yards away from the insects.
Creatures with fewer than 5 Hit Dice must
check morale; failure means they run as de-
scribed above.
Heavy smoke drives off insects within its
bounds. Fire also drives insects away; a wall
of fire in a ring shape keeps a subsequently
cast insect plague outside its confines, but a
fireball simply clears insects from its blast
area for one round. A single torch is ineffec-
tive against this vast horde of insects. Light-
ning, cold. or ice are likewise ineffective,
while a strong wind that covers the entire
plague area disperses the insects and ends
Priest Spells (5th Level) fl
the spell. The plague lasts two rounds for
each level of the caster, and thereafter the
insects disperse.
The insects swarm in an area that centers
around a summoning point detennined by
the spellcaster: the point can be up to 120
yards away from the priest. The insect
plague does not move thereafter for as long
as it lasts. Note that the spell can be coun-
tered by a dispel magic spell.
The material components of this spell are
a few grains of sugar, some kemels of grain,
and a smear of fat.
Nlaglc Font (Divination)
Sphere: Divination
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 hour
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
The spell causes a holy water font to serve
as a scrying device. The spell does not func-
tion unless the priest is in good standing
with his deity. The basin of holy water be-
comes similar to a crystal ball. For each vial
of capacity of the basin, the priest may scry
for one round, up to a maximum of one
hour; thus, the duration of the magic font
spell is directly related to the size of the holy
water receptacle. The DM will know the
chances of a character being able to detect
scrying.
The priest's holy symbol and the font and
its trappings are not consumed by the spell.
Moonhearn (Evocation. Alteration)
Sphere: Sun
Range: 60 yards + 10 yardsl level
Components: V. S, M
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 7
Saving Throw: None
Area of Effect: 5-foot-radius sphere
(plus special]
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the caster is able to
cause a beam of soft, pale light to strike
downward from overhead and illuminate
whatever area he is pointing at. The light is
exactly the same as moonlight, so that col-
ors other than shades of black, gray, or
white are vague. The spellcaster can easily
make the moonbeam move to any area that
he can see and point to. This makes the spell
an effective way to spotlight something, an
opponent, for example. While the moon-
benm spell does not eliminate all shadows, a
creature centered in a moonbeam is most
certainly visible. The reﬂected light from
this spell enables dim visual perception 10
yards beyond the area of effect, but it does
not shed a telltale glow that would negate
213
surprise. The light does not adversely affect
infravision. The caster can dim the beam to
near darkness if desired. The beam has, in
addition, all the properties of true moon-
light and can induce a lycanthropic change
(while in the beam), unless your DM niles
otherwise.
The material components are several
seeds of any moonseed plant and a piece of
opalescent feldspar (moonstone).
Pass Plant (Alteration)
Sphere: Plant
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
By using this spell, the caster is able to en-
ter a tree and move from inside it to inside
another tree of the same type that lies in ap-
proximately the direction desired by the
spell user and is within the range shown in
the following table.
Type of Tree Range of Area of Effect
Oak 600 yards
Ash
Yew
Elm
Linden
deciduous
coniferous
other
540 yards
480 yards
420 yards
360 yards
300 yards
240 yards
180 yards
The tree entered and that receiving the
caster must be of the same type, must both
be living, and of girth at least equal to that
of the caster. Note that if the caster enters a
tree, an ash, for example, and wishes to pass
north as far as possible (540 yards), but the
only appropriate ash in range is to the
south, the caster will pass to the ash in the
south. The pass plant spell functions so that
the movement takes only one round. The
caster can, at his option, remain within the
receiving tree for a maximum of one round
per level of experience. Otherwise, he can
step forth immediately. Should no like tree
be in range, the caster simply remains
within the tree, does not pass elsewhere,
and must step forth in the appropriate num-
ber of rounds. lf the occupied tree is
chopped down or bumed, the caster is slain
if he does not exit before the process is com-
plete.

i‘ Priest Spells (5th Level)
Plane Shift (Alteration)
Sphere: Astral
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Creature touched (special)
Saving Throw: Neg.
When the plane shift spell is cast, the
priest moves himself or some other creature
to another plane of existence. The recipient
of the spell remains in the new plane until
sent forth by some like means. lf several
persons link hands in a circle, up to eight
can be affected by the plane shift at the same
time.
The material component of this spell is a
small, forked metal rod—~the exact size and
metal type dictating to which plane of exist-
ence (including sub-planes and altemate
dimensions) the spell sends the affected
creatures. (Your DM will determine specifics
regarding how and what planes are
reached.)
An unwilling victim must be touched
(successful attack roll) in order to be sent; in
addition, the creature is also allowed a sav-
ing throw. lf the saving throw is successful,
the effect of the spell is negated. Note that
pinpoint accuracy is rarely achieved; arriv-
ing a random distance from an intended des-
tination is common.
The metal rod is not expended when the
spell is cast. Forked rods keyed to certain
planes may be difficult to come by, as decid-
ed by the DM.
Quest (Enchantment/Charm)
Sphere: Charm
Range: 60 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Until fulﬁlled
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.
The quest spell enables the priest to
require the affected creature to perform a
service and return to the priest with proof
that the deed was accomplished. The quest
can, for example, require that the creature
locate and retum some important or valu-
able object, rescue a notable person, release
some creature, capture a stronghold, slay a
person, deliver some item, and so forth. lf
the quest is not properly followed. due to
disregard, delay, or perversion, the creature
affected by the spell loses 1 from its saving
throw rolls for each day of such action. This
penalty is not removed until the quest is
properly pursued or the priest cancels it.
(There are certain circumstances that will
temporarily suspend a quest, and others
that will discharge or cancel it; your DM
will give you appropriate information as the
need to know arises.)
If cast upon an unwilling subject, the vic-
tim is allowed a saving throw. However if
the person quested agrees to a task, even if
the agreement is gained by force or trickery,
no saving throw is allowed. lf a quest is just
and deserved, a creature of the priest's reli-
gion cannot avoid it, and any creature of the
priest's alignment saves with a -4 penalty
to the saving throw, in any case. A quest
cannot be dispelled but can be removed by a
priest of the same religion or of higher level
than the caster. Some artifacts and relics
might negate the spell, as can direct inter-
vention by a deity. Likewise, an uniust or
undeserved quest grants bonuses to its sav-
ing throws, or might even automatically
fail!
The material component of this spell is
the priest's holy symbol.
Rainbow (Evocation, Alteration)
Sphere: Weather, Sun
Range: 120 yards
Components: V. 5, M
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
ln order to cast this spell, the priest must
be in sight of a rainbow of any sort, or have
a special component (see below). The rain-
bow spell has two applications, and the
priest can choose the desired one at the time
of casting. These applications are as fol-
lows:
Bow: The spell creates a shimmering,
multi-layered short composite bow of rain-
bow hues. lt is light and easy to pull, so that
any character can use it without penalty for
non-proficiency. lt is magical: Each of its
shimmering missiles is the equivalent of a
+2 weapon, including attack and damage
bonuses. Magic resistance can negate the
effect of any missile fired from the bow. The
bow fires seven missiles before disappear-
ing. lt can be fired up to four times per
round. Each time a missile is fired, one hue
leaves the bow, corresponding to the color
of arrow that is released. Each color of
arrow has the ability to cause double dam-
age to certain creatures, as follows:
Red—fire dwellersl users and fire elernentals
Orange-—creatures or constructs of clay,
sand, earth, stone or similar mate-
rials, and earth elementals
Yellow—-vegetable opponents (including
fungus creatures, shambling
mounds, treants, etc.)
Green—aquatic creatures and water ele-
mentals
Blue—aerial creatures, electricity-using
creatures, and air elementals.
lndigo—acid-using or poison-using crea-
tures
214 '7‘
Violet—metallic or regenerating creatures
When the bow is dravim, an arrow of the
appropriate color magically appears,
nocked and ready. lf no color is requested,
or a color that has already been used is
asked for. then the next arrow (in the order
of the spectrum) appears.
Bridge: The caster causes the rainbow to
fonn a seven-hued bridge up to three feet
wide per level of the caster. lt must be at
least 20 feet long and can be as long as 120
yards. according to the caster's desire. lt
lasts as long as the spell duration or until
ordered out of existence by the caster.
The components for this spell are the
priest's holy symbol and a vial of holy
water. If no rainbow is in the vicinity, the
caster can substitute a diamond of not less
than 1,000gp value. specially prepared with
bless and prayer spells while in sight of a
rainbow. The holy water and diamond dis-
appear when the spell is cast.
llalse Dead (Necronuncy)
Reversible
Sphere: Necromantic
Range: 30 yards
Components: V. S
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 person
Saving Throw: Special
When the priest casts a raise dead spell, he
can restore life to a dwarf, gnome, half-elf,
halfling, or hiu-nan (other creatures may be
allowed, at the DM's option). The length of
time that the person has been dead is of
importance, as the priest can raise persons
dead only up to a limit of one day for each
experience level of the priest (i.e., a 9th-
level priest can raise a person who has been
dead for up to nine days).
Note that the body of the person must be
whole, or otherwise missing parts are still
missing when the person is brought back to
life. Likewise, other ills, such as poison and
disease, are not negated. The raised person
must roll a successful resurrection survival
check to survive the ordeal (see Table 3:
Constitution) and loses I point of Constitu-
tion. Furthermore, the raised person isweak
and helpless in any event, and he needs a
minimum of one full day of rest in bed for
each day or fraction he was dead. The per-
son has but 1 hit point when raised and must
regain the rest by natural healing or curative
magic.
Note that a character's starting Constitu-
tion is an absolute limit to the number of
times the character can be revived by this
means.
The somatic component of the spell is a
pointed finger.
The reverse of the spell, slay living,



grants the victim a saving throw vs. death
magic, and if it is successful, the victim sus-
tains damage equal only to that of a cause
serious wounds spell——i.e.. 2d8+1 points.
Failure means the victim dies instantly.
Splltt Stones (Alteration. Enchantment)
Sphere: Elemental (Earth)
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 3d4 tums + 1/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 10-foot square per level, 1
spike per 1-foot sq.
Saving Throw: None
The spike stones spell causes rock to
shape itself into long, sharp points that tend
to blend into the background. lt is effective
on both natural rock and worked stone. The
spike stones serve to impede progress
through an area and to inﬂict damage. lf an
area is carefully observed, each observer is
25% likely to notice the sharp points of
rock. Otherwise, those entering the spell's
area of effect suffer 1d4 points of damage
per round. The success of each attack is
determined as if the caster of the spell were
actually engaging in combat. Those enter-
ing the area are subject to attack immedi-
ately upon setting foot in the area and for
each round spent in the area thereafter. The
initial step enables the individual to become
aware of some problem only if the initial
attack succeeds; otherwise movement con-
tinues and the spike stones remain unno-
ticed until damage occurs. Charging or
running victims suffer two attacks per
round.
Those falling into pits affected by spike
stones suffer six such attacks for every 10
feet fallen, each attack having a +2 bonus
to the attack roll. In addition, the damage
inﬂicted by each attack increases by +2 for
every 10 feet fallen. Finally, the creatures
also suffer any normal falling damage.
The material component of this spell is
four tiny stalactites.
‘lransrnute Rock to Mud (Alteration)
Reversible
Sphere: Elemental (Earth, Water)
Range: 160 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Spedal
Casting Time: B
Area of Effect: 20-foot cube/level
Saving Throw: None
This spell turns natural rock of any sort
into an equal volume of mud. If it is cast
upon a rock, for example, the rock affected
collapses into mud. Magical or enchanted
stone is not affected by the spell. The depth
of the mud created cannot nzceed 10 feet.
Priest Spells (5th Level) Ti‘
Creatures unable to levitate, ﬂy, or other-
wise free themselves from the mud sink at
the rate of 1/: of their height per round and
eventually suffocate, save for lightweight
creatures that could normally pass across
such ground. Brush thrown atop the mud
can support creatures able to climb on top
of it, with the amount required decided by
the DM. Creatures large enough to walk on
the bottom can move through the area at a
rate of 10 feet per round.
The mud remains until a successful dispel
magic or transmute mud to rock spell
restores its substance—but not necessarily
its form. Evaporation turns the mud to nor-
mal dirt at a rate of 1d6 days per 10 qibic
feet. The exact time depends on exposure to
the sun, wind, and normal drainage.
The reverse, lmnsmute mud to rock,
hardens normal mud or quicksand into soft
stone (sandstone or similar mineral) penna-
nently unless magically changed. Creatures
in the mud are allowed a saving throw to
escape before the area is hardened to stone.
Dry sand is unaffected.
The material components for the spell are
clay and water (or sand, lime, and water for
the reverse).
True Seeing (Divination)
Reversible
Sphere: Divination
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: B
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
When the priest employs this spell, he
confers upon the recipient the ability to see
all things as they actually are. The spell pen-
etrates nonnal and magical darkness. Secret
doors become plain. The exact location of
displaced things is obvious. lnvisible things
become quite visible. Illusions and appari-
tions are seen through. Polymorphed,
changed, or enchanted things are apparent.
Even the aura projected by creatures
becomes visible, so that alignment can be
discerned. Furthermore, the redpient can
focus his vision to see into the Ethereal plane
or the bordering areas of adjacent planes.
The range of vision conferred is 120 feet.
True seeing, however, does not pmetrate
solid objects; it in no way confers X-ray
vision or its equivalent. Furthermore, the
spell effects cannot be further enhanced
with known magic.
The spell requires an ointment for the
eyes that is made from very rare mushroom
powder, saffron, and fat and costs no less
than 300 gp per use.
The reverse, false seeing, causes the per-
son to see things as they are not: rich is poor,
rough is smooth, beautiful is ugly. The oint-
Z25
ment for the reverse spell is concocted of oil,
poppy dust, and pink orchid essence.
For both spells, the oinu:nent must be
aged for 1d6 months.
Wall ol ﬂre (Conjuration/Summoning)
Sphere: Elemental (Fire)
Range: 80 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
The wall of ﬁre spell bring forth an
immobile, blazing curtain of magical fire of
shimmering color—yellow-green or amber
(different from the 4th-level wizard ver-
sion). The spell creates an opaque sheet of
flame up to one 20-foot square per level of
the spellcaster, or a ring with a radius of up
to 10 feet + five feet for every two levels of
experience of the wizard, and 2.0 feet high.
Thewalloffiremustbecastsothatitis
vertical with respect to the caster. One side
of the wall, selected by the castu, sends
forth waves of heat,  Zd4 points of
damage upon creatures within 10 feet and
1d4 points of damage upon those within Z0
feet. In addition, the wall inﬂicts 4d4 points
of damage, plus 1 point of damage per level
of the spellcaster, to any creature passing
through it. Creatures especially subject to
fire may take additional damage, and
undead always take twice normal damage.
Note that attempting to directly catch mov-
ing creatures with a newly created wall of
fire is difficult; a succmful saving throw
enables the creature to avoid the wall, while
its rate and direction of movement deter-
mine which side of the created wall it is on.
The wall of fire lasts as long as the priest
concentrates on maintaining it, or one
round per level of experience of the priest in
the event he does not wish to concentrate
upon it.
The material component of the spell is
phosphorus.

Priest Spells (6th level)
Shth~level Spells
Aerial Servant
(Conjuration/Summoning)
Sphere: Summoning
Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 day/level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell summons an invisible aerial ser-
vant to find and bring back an object or
creature described to it by the priest. Unlike
an elemental, an aerial servant cannot be
commanded to fight for the caster. When it
is summoned, the priest must have cast a
protection from evil spell, be within a pro-
tective circle, or have a special item used to
control the aerial servant. Otherwise, it
attempts to slay its summoner and return
from whence it came.
The object or creature to be brought must
be such as to allow the aerial servant to
physically bring it to the priest (an aerial
servant can carry at least 1,000 pounds). If
prevented, for any reason, from completing
the assigned duty, the aerial servant
becomes insane and seeks out and attempts
to destroy the caster. The aerial servant
returns to its own plane whenever the spell
lapses, its duty is fulﬁlled, it is dispelled, the
priest releases it, or the priest is slain. The
spell lasts for a maximum of one day for
each level of experience of the priest who
cast it.
lf the creature to be fetched cannot detect
invisible objects, the aerial servant attacks,
automatically gaining surprise. If the crea-
ture involved can detect invisible objects, it
still suffers a -Z penalty to all surprise rolls
caused by the aerial servant. Each round of
combat, the aerial servant must roll to
attack. When a hit is scored, the aerial ser-
vant has grabbed the item or creature it was
sent for. A creature with a Strength rating is
allowed an evasion roll, equal to twice its
bend bars chance, to escape the hold. if the
creature in question does not have a
Strength rating, roll 1d8 for each Hit Die the

seized, the creature cannot free itself by

Anlmal Summoning lll
(Con|uration, Summoning)
Sphere: Animal, Summoning
Range: 100 yards/level
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell is the same in duration and
effect as the 4th-level animal summoning I
spell, except that up to four animals of no
more than 16 Hit Dice each can be summon-
ed, or eight of no more than B Hit Dice, or
16 creatures of no more than 4 Hit Dice.
Only animals within range of the caster at
the time the spell is cast will come. The cast-
er can try three times to summon three dif-
ferent types of animals—e.g., suppose that
wild dog are first summoned to no avail,
then hawks are unsuccessfully called, and
finally the caster calls for wild horses that
may or may not be within summoning
range. Your DM will determine the chance
of a summoned animal type being within
range of the spell. The animals summoned
will aid the caster by whatever means they
possess, staying until a fight is over, a spe-
cific mission is finished, the caster is safe, he
sends them away, etc. Only normal or giant
animals can be summoned; fantastic ani-
mals or monsters cannot be summoned by
this spell (no chimerae, dragons, gorgons,
manticores, etc.).
Animate Object (Alteration)
Sphere: Creation, Summoning
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 cubic foot/level
Saving Throw: None
This powerful spell enables the priest
casting it to imbue inanimate objects with
mobility and a semblance of life. The ani-
mated object, or objects, then attacks
whomever or whatever the priest first desig-
nates. The animated object can be of any
nonmagical material whatsoever—wood,
metal, stone, fabric, leather, ceramic, glass,
etc. Attempting to animate an object in
someone‘s possession grants that person a
saving throw to prevent the spell's effect.
The speed of movement of the object
depends on its means of propulsion and its
weight. A large wooden table would be
rather heavy, but its legs would give it
speed. A rug could only slither along. A jar
would roll. Thus a large stone pedestal
would rock forward at 10 feet per round, a
stone statue would move at 40 feet per
round, a wooden statue B0 feet per round,
an ivory stool of light weight would move at
226
120 feet per round. Slithering movement is
about 10 feet to 20 feet per round: rolling is
30 feet to 60 feet per round. The damage
caused by the attack of an animated object
depends on its form and composition. Light,
supple objects can only obscure vision,
obstruct movement, bind, trip, smother,
etc. Light, hard objects can fall upon or oth-
erwise strike for 1d2 points of damage or
possibly obstruct and trip, as do light, sup-
ple objects, Hard, medium-weight objects
can crush or strike for 2d4 points of dam-
age, while larger and heavier objects may
inflict 3d4, 4d4, or even 5d4 points of dam-
age.
The frequency of attack of animated
objects depends on their method of locomo-
tion, appendages, and method of attack.
This varies from as seldom as once every
five melee rounds to as frequently as once
per round. The Armor Class of the object
animated is basically a function of material
and movement ability. Damage depends on
the type of weapon and the object struck. A
sharp cutting weapon is effective against
fabric, leather, wood. and like substance.
Heavy smashing and crushing weapons are
useful against wood, stone, and metal
objects. Your DM will determine all of these
factors, as well as how much damage the
animated object can sustain before being
destroyed. The priest can animate one cubic
foot of material for each experience level he
has attained. Thus, a 14th-level priest could
animate one or more objects whose solid
volume did not exceed 14 cubic feet-—a large
statue, two rugs, three chairs, or a dozen
average crocks.
Antl-Animal Shell (Alzjuratlon)
Sphere: Animal, Protection
Range: O
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 tum/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 20’ diameter hemisphere
Saving Throw: None
By casting this spell, the caster brings into
being a hemispherical force field that pre-
vents the entrance of any sort of living cea-
ture that is wholly or partially animal (not
magical or extraplanar), Thus a sprite, a
giant, or a chimera would be kept out, but
undead or conjured creatures could pass
through the shell of force, as could such
monsters as aerial servants, imps, quasits,
golems, elernentals, etc. The anti-animal
shell functions non-nally against cross-
breeds, such as cambions, and lasts for one
turn for each level of experience the caster
has attained. Forcing the barrier against
creatures strains and ultimately collapses
the field.
The spell requires the casters holy symbol
and a handful of pepper.



Blade Barrier (Evontion)
Sphere: Guardian, Creation
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: 3 roundsl level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special
The priest employs this spell to set up a
wall of circling, razor-sharp blades. These
whirl and ﬂash around a central point, cre-
ating an immobile barrier. Any creature
that attempts to pass through the blade bar-
rier suffers 8d8 points of damage in doing
so. The plane of rotation of the blades can
be horizontal, vertical, or in between. Crea-
tures within the area of the barrier when it is
invoked are entitled to a saving throw vs.
spell. lf this is successful, the blades are
avoided and no damage is suffered; the
creature escapes the area of the blade barrier
by the shortest possible route. The barrier
remains for three rounds for every experi-
ence level of the priest casting it. The barrier
can cover any area from as small as five feet
square to as large as 60 feet square.
Conjure Animals
(Conjuration/Summoning)
Sphere: Summoning
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: 2 roundsl level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
The conjure animals spell enables the
priest to magically create one or more mam-
mals to attack his opponents. The total Hit
Dice of the mammals cannot exceed twice
his level, if the creature conjured is deter-
mined randomly. or his level, if a specific
animal type is requested. The DM selects
the type of animal that appears if it is ran-
domly called. Thus, a priest of 12th level
could randomly conjure two mammals with
12 Hit Dice each, four with 6 Hit Dice each,
six with 4 Hit Dice each, eight with 3 Hit
Dice each, 12 with 2 Hit Dice each, or 24
with 1 Hit Die each. Count every +1 hit
point added to a creature's Hit Dice as 1/4 of
a Hit Die. Thus a creature with 4+3 Hit
Dice equals a 43/4 Hit Dice creature. The
conjured animals remain for two rounds for
each level of the conjuring priest, or until
slain, and they follow the caster's verbal
commands. Conjured animals unfailingly
attack the priest's opponents, but resist
being used for any other purpose; they do
not like it, become noticeably more difficult
to control, and may refuse any action,
break free, or turn on the caster, depending
on the nature of the creature and the details
Priest Spells (6th level) -Y‘
of the situation. The conjured animals dis-
appear when slain.
Conjure ﬂre Elemental
(Conjuration/Summoning)
Reversible
Sphere: Elemental (Fire)
Range: 80 yards
Components: V. S
Duration: 1 tum/ level
Casting Time: 6 rounds
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
Upon casting a conjure ﬁre elemental
spell, the caster opens a special gate to the
elemental plane of Fire, and a fire elemental
is summoned to the vicinity of the spellcast-
er. It is 65% likely that a 12 Hit Dice elemen-
tal appears, 2O% likely that a 16 Hit Dice
elemental appears, 9% likely that two to
four salamanders appear, 4% likely that an
efreeti appears, and 2% likely that a huge
fire elemental of 21 to 24 Hit Dice appears.
The conjuring caster need not fear that the
elemental force summoned will tum on him,
so concentration upon the activities of the
fire elemental (or other creatures summon-
ed) or protection from the creature is not
necessary. The elemental summoned helps
the caster however possible, including
attacking opponents of the caster. The fire
elemental or other creature summoned
remains for a maximum of one tum per level
of the caster, or until it is slain, sent back by
a dispel magic spell, the reverse of this spell
(dismiss ﬁre elemental). or similar magic.
Fllld the Path (Divination)
Reversible
Sphere: Divination
Range: Touch
Components: V. S. M
Duration: 1 turnl level
Casting Time: 3 rounds
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
The recipient of this spell can find the
shortest, most direct physical route that he
is seeking, be it the way into or out of a
locale. The locale can be outdoors or tmder
ground, a trap, or even a maze spell. Note
that the spell works with respect to locales,
not objects or creatures within a locale.
Thus, the spell could not find the way to “a
forest where a green dragon lives" or to the
location of "a hoard of platinum pieces."
The location must be in the same plane as
the caster.
The spell enables the subject to sense the
correct direction that will eventually lead
him to his destination, indicating at the
appropriate times the exact path to follow
(or physical actions to take—for example,
Z11
with concentration the spell enables the sub-
ject to sense trip wires or the proper word to
bypass a glyph). The spell ends when the
destination is reached or when one tum for
each caster level has elapsed. The spell frees
the subject, and those with him. from a
maze spell in a single round, and will con-
tinue to do so as long as the spell lasts.
Note that this divination is keyed to the
caster, not his companions. and that, like
the find traps spell, it does not predict or
allow for the actions of creatures.
The spell requires a set of divination
counters of the sort favored by the priest-
bones, ivory counters, sticks, carved nines,
or whatever.
The reverse spell, lose the path, makes the
creature toud-led totally lost and unable to
find its way for the duration of the spell,
although it can be led, of course.
fire Seeds (Conjuration)
Sphere: Elemental (Fire)
Range: Touch
Components: V. S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 round/seed
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/1
The ﬁre seeds spell creates special missiles
or timed incendiaries that burn with great
heat. The spell can be cast to create either
fire seed missiles or fire seed incendiaries, as
chosen when the spell is cast.
' Fire seed missiles: This casting turns up
to four acoms into special grenade-like mis-
siles that can be hurled up to 40 yards. An
attack roll is required to strike the intended
target, and proﬁciency penalties are Consid-
ered. Each acorn bursts upon striking any
hard surface, causing 2d8 points of damage
and igniting any combustible materials
within a 10-foot diameter of the point of
impact. if a successful saving throw vs. spell
is made, a creature within the burst area
receives only one—half damage, but a crea-
ture struck directly suffers full damage (i.e.,
no saving throw).
' Fire seed incendiaries. This casting tums
up to eight holly berries into special incendi-
aries. The holly berries are most often
placed, being too light to make effective
missiles (they can be tossed up to six feet
away). They burst into ﬂame if the caster is
within 40 yards and speaks a word of com-
mand. The berries instantly ignite, causing
1d8 points of damage to any creature and
igniting any combustible within a five-foot-
diameter burst area. Creatures within the
area that successfully save vs. spell suffer
half damage.
All fire seeds lose their power after a
duration equal to one turn per experience
level of the caster—e.g.. the seeds of a 13th-
level caster remain potent for a maximum of



fl Priest Spells (6th Level)
13 turns after their creation.
No other material components beyond
acorns or holly berries are needed for this
spell.
Forblddance (Abhlration)
Sphere: Protection

Components: V. S, M
Duration: Pennanent
Casting Time: 6 rounds
Area of Effect: One 60-foot cubel level
Saving Throw: Spedal
This spell can be used to secure a conse-
crated area (see DMG). The spell seals the
area from teleportation, plane shifting, and
ethereal penetration. At the option of the
caster, the ward can be locked by a
password, in which case it can be entered
only by those speaking the proper words.
Otherwise, the effect on those entering the
enchanted area is based on their aligiment,
relative to t.he caster's. The most severe peri-
alty is used.
Alignment identical: No effect. lf
password locked, cannot enter area unless
password is known (no saving throw).
Alignment different with respect to law
and chaos: Save vs. spell to enter the area; if
failed, suffer 2d6 points of damage. If
password locked, cannot enter unless
password is known.
Alignment different with respect to good
nnd evil: Save vs. spell to enter this area: if
failed, suffer 4d6 points of damage. If word
locked, cannot enter unless password is
known. The attempt does cause damage if
the save is failed.
Once a saving throw is failed, an intruder
cannot enter the forbidden area until the
spell ceases. The ward cannot be dispelled
by a caster of lesser level than the one who
established it. intruders who enter by roll-
ing successful saving throws feel uneasy and
tense, despite their success.
ln addition to the priest's holy symbol,
components include holy water and rare
incenses worth at least 1,000 gp per 60-foot
cube. if a password lock is desired, this also
requires the buming of rare incenses worth
at least 5,000 gp per 60-foot cube.

spell. lt completely cures all diseases or
blindness of the recipient and heals all
points of damage suffered due to wounds or
injury. lt dispels a feeblemind spell. lt cures
those mental disorders caused by spells or
injury to the brain. Naturally, the effects can
be negated by later wounds, injuries, and
diseases.
The reverse, hnrm, infects the victim with

Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: 1 individual/ level
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the priest to bring forth
a great feast that serves as many creatures as
the priest has levels of experience. The spell
creates a magnificent table, chairs, service.
and all the necessary food and drink. The
feast takes one full hour to consume, and
the beneficial effects do not set in until after
this hour is over. Those partaking of the
feast are cured of all diseases, are immune to
poison for 12 hours, and are healed of
1d-i + 4 points of damage after imbibing the
nectar-like beverage that is part of the feast.
The alnbrosia-like food that is consumed is
equal to a bless spell that lasts for 12 hours.
Also, during this same period. the people
who consumed the feast are immune to fear,
hopelessness, and panic. If the feast is inter-
rupted for any reason, the spell is mined
and all effects of the spell are negated.
The material components of the spell are
the priest's holy symbol and specially fer-
mented honey taken from the cells of bee
larvae destined for royal status.

Llveoalt (Enchantment)
Sphere: Plant
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 day! level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: 1 oak tree
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the caster to charm a
healthy oak tree (or other type if the DM
allows) to cause it to serve as a protector.
The spell can be cast on a single tree at a
time. While a liueoak spell cast by a particu-
lar caster is in effect, he cannot cast another
such spell. The tree upon which the spell is
cast must be within 10 feet of the caster's
dwelling place, within a place sacred to the
caster, or within 100 yards of something
that the caster wishes to guard or protect.
The liveoak spell can be cast upon a
healthy tree of small, medium, or large size,
according to desire and availability. A trig-
gering phrase of up to a maximum of one
word per level of the spellcaster is then
placed upon the targeted oak; for instance,
"Attack any persons who come near with-
out first saying ‘sacred mistletoe’ ” is an 11-
word trigger phrase that could be used by a
caster of 11th level or higher casting the
spell. The livecnk spell triggers the tree into
animating as a treant of equivalent size, an
Armor Class of 0 and with two attaclrs per
round, but with only a 30-foot-per-round
movement rate.

Small 12’-14' 7-8 Zdﬂ
Medium 16'-19’ 9-10 3d6
Large 20'-23' + 11-12 4&6
A tree enchanted by this spell radiates a
magical aura (if checked for), and can be
returned to normal by a successful casting
of a dispel magic spell, or upon the desire of
the caster who enchanted it. lf dispelled, the
tree takes root immediately. lf released by
the caster, it tries to return to its original
location before taking root. Damage to the
tree can be healed with a plant growth spell,
which restores 3d4 points of damage. A
plant growth spell used in this fashion does
not increase the size or hit poinm of the
liveoak beyond the original value.
The caster needs his holy symbol to cast
this spell.



Part Water (Alteration)
Sphere: Elemental (Water)
Range: Z0 yardsl level
Components: V, 5, M
Duration: 1 turn/ level
Casting Time: 1 tum
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
By employing a part water spell. the
priest is able to cause water or similar liquid
to move apart, thus forming a trough. The
depth and length of the trough created by
the spell depends on the level of the priest. A
trough three feet deep per caster level, by 30
yards wide, by 20 yards long per level is cre-
ated. Thus at 12th level, the priest would
part water 36 feet deep by 30 yards wide by
240 yards long. The trough remains as long
as the spell lass or until the priest who cast
it opts to end its effects. Existing currents
appear to flow through the parted water,
although swimming creatures and physical
objects such as boats do not enter the rift
without strenuous and deliberate effort. lf
cast undemater, this spell creates an air cyl-
inder of appropriate length and diameter. If
cast directly on a water elemental or other
water-based creature, the creature receives
4d8 points of damage and must roll a suc-
cessful saving throw vs. spell or ﬂee in panic
for 3d4 rounds.
The material component of this spell is
the priest's holy symbol.

Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
When cast. the speak with monsters spell
enables the priest to converse with any type
of creature that has any form of communi-
cative ability (including empathic, tactile,
pheromonic, etc.). That is, the monster
understands, in its own language or equiva-
lent, the intent of what is said to it by the
priest and vice versa. The creature thus spo-
ken to is checked by your DM in order to
detennine reaction. All creatures of the
same type as that chosen by the priest can
likewise understand if they are within
range. The priest can speak to different
types of creatures during the spell duration.

Saving Throw: None
When the priest casts a stone tell spell
upon an area, the very stones speak and
relate to the caster who or what has touched
them as well as telling what is covered, con-
cealed, or simply behind them. The stones
relate complete descriptions, if asked. Note
that a stone's perspective, perception, and
knowledge may hinder this divination; such
details, if any, are decided by the DM.
The material components for this spell are
a drop of mercury and a bit of clay.
Ttansmute Water to Dust (Alteration)
Reversible
Sphere: Elemental (Water, Earth)
Range: 60 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 1 cubic yard/level
Saving Throw: Special
When this spell is cast, the subject area
instantly undergoes a change from liquid to
powdery dust. Note that if the water is
already muddy, the area of effect is doubled,
while if wet mud is present, the area of effect
is quadrupled. l.f water remains in contact
with the transmuted dust, the former quick-
ly permeates the latter, tuming the dust into
silty mud, if a sufficient quantity of water
exists to do so, otherwise soaking or damp-
ening the dust accordingly.
Only the liquid actually in the area of
effect at the moment of spellcasting is affect-
ed. Potions that contain water as a compo-
nent part are rendered useless. Living
creatures are unaffected, except for those
native to the elemental plane of Water. Such
creatures must roll a successful saving
throws vs. death or be slain; however, only
one such creature can be affected by any sin-
gle casting of this spell, regardless of the
creature's size or the size of the spell's area of
effect.
The reverse of this spell is simply a very
high-powered create water spell that
requires a pinch of normal dust as an addi-
tional material component.
For either usage of the spell, other compo-
nents required are diamond dust of at least
500 gp value, a bit of seashell, and the cast-
er's holy symbol.

Transport Vla Plants (Alteration)
Sphere: Plant
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the caster is able to
enter any large plant (human-sized or larg-
er) and pass any distance to a plant of the
same species in a single round, regardless of
the distance, separating the two. The entry
plant must be alive. The destination plant
need not be familiar to the caster, but it also
must be alive. If the caster is uncertain of the
destination plant, he need merely determine
direction and distance, and the transport via
plants spell moves him as close as possible
to the desired location. There is a basic 20%
chance, reduced by 1% per level of experi-
ence of the caster, that the transport delivers
the caster to a similar species of plant from 1
to 100 miles away from the desired destina-
tion plant. lf a particular destination plant is
desired, but the plant is not living. the spell
fails and the caster must come forth from
the entrance plant within 24 hours. Note
that this spell does not function with plant-
like creatures—e.g., shambling mounds,
treants, etc. The destruction of an occupied
plant slays the caster (see the plant door
spell).
Turn Wood (Alteration)
Sphere: Plant
Range: O
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round/ level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 120-foot-wide path,
20 feet long/ level
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, waves of force roll
forth from the caster, moving in the direc-
tion he faces, and causing all wooden
objects in the path of the spell to be pushed
away from the caster to the limit of the area
of effect. Wooden objects above three inch-
es in diameter that are fixed firmly are not
affected, but loose objects (movable man-
tles, siege towers, etc.) move back. Objects
under three inches in diameter that are fixed
splinter and break, and the pieces move
with the wave of force. Thus, objects such
as wooden shields, spears, wooden weapon
shafts and hafts, and arrows and bolts are
pushed back, dragging those carrying them
with them. lf a spear is planted in order to
prevent this forced movement, it splinters.
Even magical items with wooden sections
are tumed, although an anti—magic shell
blocks the effects. A successful dispel magic
spell ends the effect. Otherwise, the tum



>% Priest Spells (7th level)
wood spell lasts for one round for each
experience level of the caster.
The waves of force continue to sweep
down the set path for the spell's duration,
pushing back wooden objects in the area of
effect at a rate of 40 feet per melee round.
The length of the path is 20 feet per level of
the caster, thus a 14th-level caster casts a
tum wood spell with an area of effect 120
feet wide by Z80 feet long, and the spell lasts
for 14 rounds. Note that after casting the
spell, the path is set and the caster can then
do other things or go elsewhere without
affecting the spelI's power.
Wall of Thorns

Range: 80 yards
Components: V, 5
Duration: 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: One 10-foot cube/level
Saving Throw: None
The wall of thoms spell creates a barrier of
very tough, pliable, tangled brush bearing
needle-sharp thoms as long as a person's fin-
ger. Any creature breaking through (or
crashing into) the wall of thorns suffers B
points of damage, plus an additional amount
of damage equal to the creature's AC. Nega-
tive ACs subtract from the base 8 points of
damage, but no adjustment is made for Dex-
terity. Any creature within the area of effect
of the spell when it is cast crashes into the
wall of thoms, and must break through to
move. The damage is based on each 10-foot
thidcness of the barrier.
if the wall of thoms is chopped at, it takes
at least four turns to cut a path through a 10-
foot thickness. Normal fire cannot ham: the
barrier, but magical fires bum away the bar-
rier in two turns, creating a wall of fire effect
while doing so (see wnll of fire spell). ln this
case, the cool side of the wall is that closest
to the caster of the thom wall.
The nearest edge of the wall of thoms
appears up to 80 yards distant from the cast-
er, as he desires. The spell lasts for one tum
for each level of experience of the caster.
covers one 10-foot cube per level of the cast-
er in whatever shape the caster desires. Thus
a 14th-level caster could create a wall of
thorns up to 70 feet long by 20 feet high (or
deep) by 10 feet deep (or high), a 10-foot-
high by 10-foot-wide by 140-foot-long wall
to block a dungeon passage, or any other
sort of shape that suited his needs. The cast-
er can also create a wall of five-foot thick-
ness. which inﬂicts half damage but can be
doubled in one of the other dimensions.
Note that those with the ability to pass
through overgrown areas are not hindered
by this barrier. The caster can dismiss the
barrier on command.

By this spell, the caster calls forth weather
appropriate to the climate and season of the
area he is in at the time. Thus, in spring a
tornado. thunderstorm. cold, sleet storm,
or hot weather could be summoned. In sum-
mer a torrential rain, heat wave, hail storm,
etc., can be called for. ln autumn, hot or
cold weather, fog, sleet, etc., could be sum-
moned. Winter enables great cold, blizzard,
or thaw conditions to be summoned.
Hurricane-force winds can be summoned
near coastal regions in the late winter or ear-
ly spring. The summoned Weather is not
under the control of the caster. lt might last
but a single turn, in the case of a tornado, or
for hours or even days in other cases. The
area of effect likewise varies from about one
square mile to 100 square miles. Note that
several casters can act in concert to greatly
affect weather, controlling winds, and
working jointly to summon very extreme
weather conditions.
Within four turns after the spell is cast.
the trend of the weather to come is
apparent—e.g., clearing skies, gusts of
warm or hot air, a chill breeze, overcast
skies, etc. Summoned weather arrives
1d12 +5 tums after the spell is cast. Note
that the new weather condition cannot be
changed by the caster once it has been sum-

ed, it cannot be dispelled. if the summoning
is successfully dispelled before it has been
completed, the weather slowly reverts to its
original condition.
Word of Recall (Alteration)
Sphere: Summoning
Range: 0
Components: V
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
The word of recall spell takes the priest
instantly back to his sanctuary when the
word is uttered. The sanctuary must be spe-
cifically designated in advance by the priest
and must be a well-known place. The actual
point of arrival is a designated area no larg-
er than 10’ X 10’. The priest can be trans-
ported any distance, from above or below
ground. Transportation by the word of
recall spell is safe within a plane, but for
each plane the priest is removed, there is a
130
10% cumulative chance that the priest is
irrevocably lost. The priest is able to trans-
port, in addition to himself, 25 pounds of
weight per experience level. Thus, a 15th-
level priest could transport his person and
an additional 375 pounds weight. This extra
matter can be equipment, treasure, or even
living material, such as another person.
Exceeding this limit causes the spell to fail.
Note that unusually strong physical fields
(e.g.. magnetic, gravitational) or magical
forces can, at the DM's option, make the use
of this spell hazardous or impossible.
Seventh-level Spells
Animate ROCK (Alteration)
Sphere: Elemental (Earth)
Range: 40 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 2 cubic feet/level
Saving Throw: None
By employing an animate rock spell, the
caster causes a stone object of up to the indi-
cated size to move (see the 6th-level animate
object spell.) The animated stone object
must be separate (not a part of a huge boul-
der or the like). lt follows the desire of the
caster-—attacking, breaking objects, block-
ing—while the magic lasts. It has no intelli-
gence or volition of its own, but it follows
instructions exactly as spoken. Note that
only one set of instructions for one single
action (the whole being simply worded and
very bi-ief—12 words or so) can be given to
the animated rock. The rock remains ani-
mated for one round per experience level of
the caster. The volume of rock that can be
animated is also based on the experience
level of the caster—two cubic feet of stone
per level—e.g., Z4 cubic feet. a mass of
about man-sized, at 12th level.
While the exact details of the animated
rock are decided by the DM, its Armor
Class is no worse than 5, and it has 1d3 hit



points per cubic foot of volume. lt uses the
attack roll of the caster. The maximum dam-
age it can inﬂict is 1d2 points per caster level
(thus, a 12th-level caster's rock might inflict
12 to 24 points of damage). Movement, for
a man-sized rock, is 60 feet per round. A
rock generally weighs from 100 to 300
pounds per cubic foot.
The material components for the spell are
a stone and drop of the caster’s blood.
Astral Spell (Alteration)
Sphere: Astral
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: ‘/2 hour
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
By means of the astral spell, a priest is
able to project his astral body into the As-
tral plane, leaving his physical body and
material possessions behind on the Prime
Material plane. As the Astral plane touches
upon the first levels of all the outer planes,
the priest can travel astrally to the ﬁrst level
of any of these outer planes as he wills. The
priest then leaves the Astral plane. fonning
a body on the plane of existence he has cho-
sen to enter. lt is also possible to travel as-
trally anywhere in the Prime Material plane
by means of the astral spell (however, a sec-
ond body cannot be formed on the Prime
Material plane; see following).
As a general rule, a person astrally pro-
jected can be seen only by creatures on the
Astral plane. The astral body is connected
at all times to the material body by a silvery
cord. If the cord is broken, the affected per-
son is killed, astrally and materially, but
generally only the psychic wind can cause
the cord to break. When a second body is
formed on a different plane, the silvery cord
remains invisibly attached to the new body.
If the second body or astral form is slain, the
cord simply retums to the caster’s body
where the body rests on the Prime Material
plane, reviving it from its state of suspended
animation. Although astral projections are
able to function on the Astral plane, their
actions affect only creatures existing on the
Astral plane; a physical body must be mate-
rialized on other planes.
The spell lasts until the priest desires to
end it, or until it is terminated by some out-
side means (such as a dispel magic spell or
destruction of the priest's body on the Prime
Material plane lwhich kills the priestl). The
priest can project the astral forms of up to
seven other creatures with himself by means
of the astral spell, providing the creatures
are linked in a circle with the priest. These
fellow travelers are dependent upon the
priest and can be stranded if something hap-
pens to the priest. Travel in the Astral plane
Priest Spells (1th Level) i‘
can be slow or fast, according to the priest's
desire. The ultimate destination arrived at is
subject to the desire of the priest.
Changestaff (Evocatlon, Enchantment)
Sphere: Plant, Creation
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: The caster's staff
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the caster is able to
change a specially prepared staff into a
treant-like creature of the largest size (about
24 feet tall). When the priest plants the end
of the staff in the ground and speaks a spe-
cial command and invocation, the staff
turns into a treant-like creature with 12 Hit
Dice, 40 hit points, and Armor Class 0. lt at-
tacks twice per round, inflicting 4d6 points
of damage with every successful attack. The
staff-treant defends the caster and obeys
any spoken commands. However, it is by no
means a tme treant: it cannot converse with
actual treants or control trees. The transfor-
mation lasts either for as many turns as the
caster has experience levels, until the caster
commands the staff to return to its tme
fonn, or until the staff is destroyed. which-
ever occurs first. lf the staff-treant is re-
duced to 0 hit points or less, it crumbles to a
sawdust-like powder and the staff is de-
stroyed. Otherwise, the staff can be used
again after Z4 hours and the staff-treant is at
full strength.
To cast a changestaff spell, the caster must
have either his holy symbol or leaves (ash,
oak, or yew) of the same sort as the staff.
The staff for the cl-iangestaff spell must be
specially prepared. The staff must be a
sound limb cut from an ash, oak, or yew
tree struck by lightning no more than 24
hours before the limb is cut. The limb must
then be cured by sun drying and special
smoke for Z8 days. Then it must be shaped,
carved, and polished for another 28 days.
The caster cannot adventure or engage in
other strenuous activity during either of
these periods. The finished staff, engraved
with woodland scenes, is then nibbed with
the juice of holly berries, and the end of it is
thrust into the earth of the caster's grove
while he casts a speak with plant spell, call-
ing upon the staff to assist in time of need.
The item is then charged with a magic that
will last for many changes from staff to
treant and back again.

Chariot Of Sustarre (Evocation)
Sphere: Elemental (Fire), Creation
Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 12 hours
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, it brings forth a
large, flaming chariot pulled by two fiery
horses from the elemental plane of Fire.
These appear in a clap of thunder amid a
cloud of smoke. The vehicle moves at Z4 on
the ground, 48 ﬂying, and can carry the
caster and up to seven other ueatures of
man-size or less (the passengers must be
touched by the caster to protect them from
the flames of the chariot). Creatures other
than the caster and his designated passen-
gers sustain 2d4 points of fire damage each
round if they come within five feet of the
horses or chariot. Such creatures suffer no
damage if they evade the area by rolling suc-
cessful saving throws vs. petrification, with
Dexterity adjustments.
The caster controls the chariot by verbal
command, causing the ﬂaming steeds to
stop or go, walk, trot, run or fly, and turn
left or right as he desires. Note that the char-
iot of Sustarre is a physical manifestation
and can sustain damage. The vehicle and
steeds are struck only by magical weapons
or by water (one quart of which inflicts 1
point of damage), they are Armor Class 2,
and each requires 30 points of damage to
dispel. Naturally, fire has absolutely no ef-
fect upon either the vehicle or its steeds, but
magical fires other than those of the chariot
can affect the riders. Other spells, such as a
successful dispel magic or holy word, will
force the chariot back to its home plane,
without its passengers. The chariot can be
summoned only once per week.
The material components are a small
piece of wood, two holly berries, and a fire
source at least equal to a torch.
Confusion (EnchantmentICl\arm)
Sphere: Charm
Range: 80 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 roundl level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1d4 creatures within
a 40' by 40'square
Saving Throw: Special
This spell causes confusion in one or more
creatures within the area, creating indeci-
sion and the inability to take effective
action. The spell affects 1d4 creatures, plus
one creature per two caster levels. Thus,
seven to ten creatures can be affected by a
1Zth- or 13th-level caster, eight to 11 by a
14th» or 15th-level caster, etc. These crea-



'f Priest Spells (7th Level)
tures are allowed saving throws vs. spell
with -2 penalties, adjusted for Wisdom.
Those successfully saving are unaffected by
the spell. Confused creatures react as fol-
lows (roll 1d10):
D10
Roll Reaction
1 Wander away (unless prevented) for
duration of spell
2-6 Stand confused one round
(then roll again)
7-9 Attack nearest creature for one round
(then roll again)
10 Act normally for one round
(then roll again)
The spell lasts one round for each level of
the caster. Those who fail their saving
throws are checked by the DM for actions
each round, for the duration of the spell, or
until the "wander away for the duration of
the spell" result occurs.
Wandering creatures move as far from the
caster as possible in their most typical mode
of movement (characters walk, fish swim,
bats fly, etc.). This is not panicked ﬂight.
Wandering creatures also have a 50%
chance of using any special innate move-
ment abilities (plane shift, burrowing,
ﬂight, etc.). Saving throws and actions are
checked at the beginning of each round.
Any confused creature that is attacked per-
ceives the attacker as an enemy and acts
according to its basic nature.
The material component of this spell is a
set of three nut shells.
Note: If there are many creatures
involved, the DM may decide to assume
average results. For example, if there are 16
orcs affected and 25% could be expected to
successfully roll the saving throw, then four
are assumed to have succeeded, one wan-
ders away, four attack the nearest creature,
six stand confused and the last acts normal-
ly but must check next round. Since the orts
are not near the party, the DM decides that
two who are supposed to attack the nearest
creature attack each other, one attacks an
orc that saved, and one attacks a confused
orc. which strikes back. The next round, the
base is 11 orcs, since four originally saved
and one wandered off. Another one wan-
ders off, five stands confused, four attack,
and one acts normally.

A caster who performs a conjure earth
elemenlnl spell summons an earth elemental
to do his bidding. The elemental is 60%
likely to have 12 Hit Dice, 35% likely to
have 16 Hit Dice, and 5% likely have 21 to

caster as a friend to be obeyed. The elemen-
tal remains until destroyed, dispelled. sent

Control Weather (Alteration)
Sphere: Weather
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 4d12 hours
Casting Time: 1 tum
Area of Effect: 4d4 square miles
Saving Throw: None
The control weather spell enables a prist
to change the weather in the local area. The
spell affects the weather for 4d12 hours in an
area of 4d4 squaremiles. lt requires one turn
to cast the spell, and an additional 1d4 turns
for the effects of the spell to be felt. The cur-
rent weather conditions are decided by the
DM, depending on the climate and season.
Weather conditions have three componmts:
precipitation, temperature, and wind. The
spell can change these conditions according
to the following chart:
The upper-case headings represent arist-
ing weather conditions. The lower-case
headings below each upper-case heading are
the new conditions to which the caster can
change the existing conditions. Further-
more, the caster can control the direction of
the wind. For example, a day that is clear,
warm, and with moderate wind can be con-
trolled to become hazy, hot, and calm. Con-
tradictions are not possible—fog and strong
wind, for example. Multiple control menth-
er spells can be used only ir\ succession.
The material components for this spell are
the priest's religious symbol, incense, and
prayer beads or similar prayer object. Obvi-
ously, this spell functions only in areas
where there are appropriate climatic condi-
tions.
If Weather is a major sphere for the priest
(as it is for druids), duration and area are
doubled, and the caster can change the pre-
vailing weather by two places (e.g., he can
cause precipitation to go from partly cloudy
to heavy sleet, temperature to go from cool
to arctic, and wind to go from calm to
strong).

commands. The creeping doom slays any
creature subject to normal attacks, as each
of the small honors inﬂicts 1 point of dam-
age (each then dies after its attack), so that
up to 1,000 points of damage can be in-
ﬂicted on creatures within the path of the
creeping doom. If the creeping doom goes
more than 80 yards away from the sum-
moner, it loses 50 of its number for each 10
yards beyond 80 yards (e.g., at 100 yards,
its number has shrunk by 100). There are a
number of ways to thwart or destroy the
creatures forming the swarm. The solutions
are left to the imaginations of players and
DMs.
iarthquake (Alteration)
Sphere: Elemental (Earth)
Range: 120 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time; 1 turn
Area of Effect: 5-foot diameterl level
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast by a priest, a local
tremor of fairly high strength rips the
ground. The shock is over in one round.
The earthquake affects all terrain, vegeta-
tion, structures, and creatures in its area of
effect. The area of effect of the earthquake
spell is circular, with a diameter of five feet
for every experience level of the priest cast-
ing it. Thus a 20th-level priest casts an
earthquake spell with a 100-foot~diameter
area of effect.
Priest Spells (7th Level)
Solidly built structures with foundations
reaching down to bedrock sustain one-half
damage; one-quarter damage if they score
above 50% on a saving throw. An earth ele-
mental opposed to the caster in the area of
effect can negate 10% to 100% (roll 1d10,
0 ' 100%) of the effect. Other magical
protections and wards allowed by the DM
may also reduce or negate this effect. lf cast
undersea, this spell may, at the discretion of
the DM, Create a tsunami or tidal wave.
The material components for this spell are
a pinch of dirt, a piece of rock. and a lump

Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is employed, the priest
confronts some powerful creature from an-
other plane (including devas and other pow-
erful minions, for instance, but not
demigods or deities of any sort) and requires
of it some duty or quest. A creature of an
alignment opposed to the priest (e.g., evil if
the priest is good, chaotic if the priest is law-
ful) cannot be ordered around unless it is
willing. Note that an absolute (true) neutral
creature is effectively opposed to both good
and evil, and both law and chaos.

The spellcaster must know something
about the creature to exact service from it,
or else he must offer some fair trade in re-
tum for the service. That is, if the priest is
aware that the creature has received some
favor from someone of the priest's align-
ment, then the emction spell can name this
as cause; if no balancing reason for service is
known, then some valuable gift or service
must be pledged in return for the exaction.
The service exacted must be reasonable with
respect to the past or promised favor or re~
ward, and with the being's effort and risk.
The spell then acts, subject to a magic resist-
ance roll, as a quest upon the being that is to
perform the required service. Immediately
upon completion of the service, the being is
transported to the vicinity of the priest, and
the priest must then and there return the
promised reward. whether it is irrevocable
cancellation of a past debt or the giving of
some service or other material reward. Af-
ter this is done, the creature is instantly
freed to return to its own plane.
The DM adiudicates when an equitable
arrangement has been reached. If the caster
requests too much, the creature is free to de-
part or to attack the priest (as if the agree-
ment were breached) according to its
nature. If circumstances leave the situation
unbalanced (for example, the creature dies
while achieving a result that was not worth
the creature dying), then this might create a
debt owed by the caster to the creature's sur-
viving kith and kin, making the caster vul-
nerable to a future emction from that
quarter. Agreeing to a future exaction or re-
lease in the event of catastrophic failure or
death are common caster pledges in securing
an exaction.
Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter
results in the priest being subject to exaction
by the subject creature or by its master.
liege, etc., at the very least. At worst, the
creature may attack the reneging priest
without fear of any of his spells affecting it,
for the priest's failure to live up to the bar-
gain gives the creature total immunity from
the priest's spell powers.
The material components of this spell are
the priest's holy symbol, some matter or
substance from the plane of the creature
from whom an exaction is expected, and
knowledge of the creature's nature or
actions that is written out on a parchment
that is bumed to seal the pledge.



f Priest Spells (7th Level)
Fire Storm (Evocauon)
Reversible
Sphere: Elemental (Fire)
Range: 160 yards
Components: V. S
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 20-foot cube/ level, mini-
mum 16 10-foot cubes
Saving Throw: ‘/2
When a fire storm spell is cast, the whole
area is shot through with sheets of roaring
ﬂame that equal a wall of fire spell in effect.
Creatures within the area of fire and 10 feet
or less from the edge of the affected area
receive 2d8 points of damage plus addition-
al damage equal to the caster's level (2d8 +
1/level). Creatures that roll successful sav-
ing throws vs. spell suffer only one-half
damage. The damage is inﬂicted each round
the q-eature stays in the area of effect. The
area of effect is equal to two 10’ x 10' cubes
per level of the caster—e.g., a 13th-level
caster can cast a fire storm measuring 130’ x
20' x 10'. The height of the storm is 10 or Z0
feet: the balance of its area must be in length
and Width.
The reverse spell. ﬁn: quench, smothers
twice the area of effect of a fire storm with
respect to normal fires, and the normal area
of effect with respect to magical fires. Fire-
based creatures, such as elementals, sala-
manders, etc.. of less than demigod status
have a a 5% chance per experience level of
the caster of being extinguished. If cast only
against a ﬂnmetongue sword, the sword
must roll a successful saving throw vs.
crushing blow or be rendered nonmagical.
Such a sword in the possession of a creature
first receives the creature's saving throw.
and if this is successful, the second saving
throw is automatically successful.
Gate (Coniuration/Summoning)
Sphere: Summoning
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: Spedal
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
Casting a gate spell has two effects: it
causes an interdimensional connection
between the plane of existence the priest is in
and the plane in which dwells a specific
being of great power. The result of this con-
nection is that the sought-after being can
step through the gate or portal, from its
plane to that of the priest. Uttering the spell
attracts the attention of the dweller on the
other plane. When casting the spell, the
priest must name the entity he desires to
make use of the gate and to come to his aid.
There is a 100% chance that something
steps through the gate. The actions of the
being that comes through depend on many
factors, including the alignment of the
priest, the nature of those accompanying
him, and who or what opposes or threatens
the priest. Your DM will decide the exact
result of the spell, based on the creature
called, the desires of the caster and the needs
of the moment. The being gated in either
returns immediately or remains to take
action. Casting this spell ages the priest five
years.

Saving Throw: None
When a regenerate spell is cast, body
members (fingers, toes, hands, feet, arms,
legs, tails, or even the heads of multi-headed
creatures), bones, and organs grow back.
The process of regeneration requires but one
round if the severed member(s) is (are)
present and touching the creature, 2:14 tums
otherwise. The creature must be living to
receive the benefits of this spell. If the sev-
ered member is not present, or if the injury
is older than one day per caster level, the
recipient must roll a successful system shod:
check to survive the spell.
The reverse, wither, causes the member
or organ touched to shrivel and cease func-
tioning in one round, dropping off into dust
in 2d4 turns. Creatures must be touched for
the harmful effect to occur.

indicated, the character must be created. At
the DM's option, certain special (expensive)
incenses can be used that may increase the
chance for a character to retum as a specific
race or species. A wish spell can restore a
reincarnated character to its original fon'n

DM's choice
If an unusual creature form is indicated,
the DM can (at his option only) use the
guidelines for new player character races to
allow the character to eam experience and
advance in levels, although this may not be
in the same class as before. If the reincarnat-
ed character returns as a creature eligible to
be the same class as he was previously (i.e.,
a human ﬁghter returns as an elf), the rein-
carnated character has half his previous
levels and hit points. if the character returns
as a new character class, his hit points are
half his previous total, but he must begin
again at 1st level. lf the character retums as
a creature unable to have a class, he has half
the hit poi.r\ts and saving throws of his pro
vious incamation.
lestoratlon (Necromancy)
Reversible
Sphere: Necromantic
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 3 rounds
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, the life energy
level of the recipient creature is raised by
one. This reverses any previous life energy
level drain of the creature by a force or mon-
Priest Spells (7th Level) i‘
ster. Thus, if a 10th—level character had been
struck by a Wight and drained to 9th level,
the restoration spell would bring the charac-
ter up to exactly the number of experience
points necessary to restore him to 10th level
once again, restoring additional Hit Dice (or
hit points) and level functions accordingly.
Restoration is effective only if the spell is
cast within one day of the recipient's loss of
life energy, per experience level of the priest
casting it. A restoration spell restores the
intelligence of a creature affected by a
feeblemind spell. lt also negates all forms of
insanity. Casting this spell ages both the
caster and the recipient by two years.
The reverse, energy drain. draws away
one life energy level (see such undead as
spectre, Wight, and vampire, in the Mon-
strous Compendium). The energy drain
requires the victim to be touched. Casting
this form of the spell does not age the caster.
Resurrection (Necronuncy)
Reversible
Sphere: Necromantic
Range: Touch
Components: V. 5. M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
The priest employing this spell is able to
restore life and complete strength to any living
creature, including elves, he bestows the usur-
rection spell upon. The creature can have been
dead up to 10 years per level of the priest cast-
ing the spell. Thus a 19th-level priest can res-
urrect the bones of a creature dead up to 190
years. The creature, upon surviving a resur-
rection survival check, is immediately
restored to full hit points and can perform
strenuous activity. The spell cannot bring back
acreaturethathasreacheditsallottedlifespan
(i.e., died of natural causes). Casting this spell
malts it irnposible for the priest to out fur-
ther spells or engag in combat until he has
had one day of bed rest for each experience
level or Hit Die of the creature brought back
tolife.The¢asteragesthreeyearsupon rast-
The reverse, destruction, causes the vic-
tim of the spell to be instantly dead and
turned to dust. A wish spell or equivalent is
required for recovery. Destruction requires
a touch. either in combat or otherwise, and
does not age the caster. In addition, the vic-
tim is allowed a saving throw (with a -4
penalty). if the save is successful, the victim
receives 8d6 points of damage instead.
The material components of the spell are
the priest's religious symbol and holy water
(unholy water for the reverse spell). The
DM may reduce the chances of successful
resurrection if little of the creature's remains
are available.

Succor (Alteration, Enchantment)
Reversible
Sphere: Summoning
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 Clay
Area of llfect: Special
Saving Throw: None
By casting this spell, the priest creates a
powerful magic in some specially prepared
object-a string of prayer beads, a small
day tablet, an ivory baton, etc. This object
radiates magic, for it contains the power to
instantaneously transport its possessor to
the sanctuary of the priest who created its
magic. Once the item is enchanted, the
priest must give it willingly to a.n individual.
at the same time informing him of a com-
mand word to be spoken when the item is to
be used. To make use of the item, the recipi-
ent must speak the command word at the
same time that he rends or breaks the item.
When this is done, the individual and all
that he is wearing and canying (up to the
maximum encumbrance limit for the char-
acter) are instantly transported to the sanc-
tuary of the priest, iust as if the individual
were capable of speaking a word of recall
spell. No other creatures can be affected.
The reversed application of the spell
causes the priest to be transported to the
immediate vicinity of the possmsor of the
item when it is broken and the command
word said. The priest has a general idea of
the location and situation of the item's pos-
sessor, and can choose not to be affected by
this summons. This decision is made at the
instant when the transportation is to take
place, but if he chooses not to go, then the
opportunity is gone forever and the spell is
wasted.
The cost of preparing the special item (for
either version of the spell) varies from 2,000
to 5,000 gp. The more costly items can
transport the subject from one plane of
existence to another, if the DM allows. Note
that the same factors that can prevent the
operation of the plane shift and teleport
spells can also prevent the use of this spell.
Sunray (Evocation, Alteration)
Sphere: Sun
Range: 10 yards/level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 + 1d4 rounds
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 5-foot-radius sphere
(plus special)
Saving Throw: Special
With this spell, the caster can evoke a
dazzling beam of light each round in which
no action other than movement is per-
formed. The sunray is like a ray of natural



Priest Spells (7th Level)
sunlight. All creatures in the 10-foot-
diameter area of effect must roll successful
saving throws vs. spell or be blinded for 1d3
rounds, those using infravision at the time
for 2d4 rounds. Creatures to whom Sunlight
is harmful or unnatural suffer permanent
blindness if the saving throw is failed, and
are blinded for Zdé rounds if the saving
throw is successful. Those within its area of
effect, as well as creatures within 20 feet of
its perimeter, lose any infravision capabili-
ties for 1d4 1* 1 rounds.
Undead caught within the sunray's area of
effect receive bdb points of damage, one-
half if a saving throw vs. spell is successful,
Those undead 20 feet to either side of the
sunray's area of effect receive 3d6 points of
damage, no damage if a save is successful.
In addition, the ray may result in the total
destruction of those undead specifically af-
fected by sunlight, if their saving throws are
failed. The ultraviolet light generated by the
spell inflicts damage on fungoid creatures
and subterranean fungi just as if they were
undead, but no saving throw is allowed.
The material components are an aster
seed and a piece of aventurine feldspar (sun-
stone).
Symbol (ConiurationlSummoningl
Sphere: Guardian
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Neg.
The priest casting this spell inscribes a
glowing symbol in the air or upon any sur-
face, according to his desire. Any creature
looking at the completed symbol within 60
feet must roll a successful saving throw vs.
spell or suffer the effect. The symbol glows
for one turn for each experience level of the
caster. The particular symbol used is se-
lected by the caster at the time of casting.
The caster will not be affected by his own
symbol. One of the following effects is cho-
sen by the caster:
Hopelessness: Creatures seeing it must turn
back in deiection or surrender to capture
or attack unless they roll successful sav-
ing throws vs. spell. lts effects last for
3d4 turns.
Pain: Creatures affected suffer -4 penalties
to their attack rolls and -2 penalties to
their Dexterity ability scores due to
wracking pains. The effects last for 2d10
tums.
Persuasion: Creatures seeing the symbol be-
come of the same alignment as and
friendly to the priest who scribed the
symbol for id20 turns unless a saving
throw vs. spell is successful.
The material components of this spell are
mercury and phosphorus (see 8th-level wiz-
ard spell, symbol).
Transmute Metal to Wood (Alteration)
Sphere: Elemental (Earth)
Range: B0 yards
Components: V, 5, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 metal object
Saving Throw; Special
The transmute metal to wood spell en-
ables the caster to change an object from
metal to wood. The volume of metal cannot
exceed a maximum weight of 10 pounds per
experience level of the priest. Magical ob-
jects made of metal are 90% resistant to the
spell. and those on the person of a creature
receive the creature's saving throw as well.
Artifacts and relics cannot be transmuted.
Note that only a wish spell or similar magic
can restore a transmuted object to its metal-
lic state. Otherwise. for example, a metal
door changed to wood would be forever-
rnore a wooden door.

Wlnd Willi (Alteration)
Sphere: Elemental (Air)
Range: Touch
Components; V, S, M
Duration: I hour/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the priest, and possibly
one or two other persons, to alter the sub-
stance of his body to a cloud-like vapor. A
magical wind then wafts the priest along at a
movement rate of 60, or as slow as 6, as the
spellcaster wills. The wind walk spell lasts
as long as the priest desires, up to a maxi-
mum duration of six turns (one hour) per ex-
perience level of the caster. For every 8
levels of experience the priest has attained,
up to 24, he is able to touch another person
and carry that person, or those persons,
along on the wind walk. Persons wind
walking are not invisible. but rather appear
misty and translucent. lf fully clothed in
white, they are 80% likely to be mistaken
for clouds, fog, vapors, etc. The priest can
regain his physical form as desired, each
change to and from vaporous form requir-
ing five rounds. While in vaporous form,
the priest and companions are hit only by
magic or magical weaponry, though they
may be subject to high winds at the DM's
discretion. No spellcasting is possible in va-
porous form.
The material components of this spell are
fire and holy water.
