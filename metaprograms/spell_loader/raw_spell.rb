First-Level Spells

Animal Friendship
(Enchantment/Charm)

Sphere: Animal

Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 hour
Area of Effect: 1 animal
Saving Throw: Neg.

By means of this spell, the caster is able to
show any animal of animal intelligence to
semi-intelligence (i.e., Intelligence 1-4) that
he desires friendship. If the animal does not
roll a successful saving throw vs. spell im-
mediately when the spell is begun, it stands
quietly while the caster finishes the spell.
Thereafter, it follows the caster about. The
spell functions only if the caster actually
wishes to be the animal s friend, If the caster
has ulterior motives, the animal always
senses them (e.g., the caster intends to eat
the animal, send it ahead to set off traps,
etc.).

The caster can teach the befriended ani-
mal three specific tricks or tasks for each
point of Intelligence it possesses. Typical
tasks are those taught to a dog or similar pet
(i.e., they cannot be complex). Training for
each such trick must be done over a period
of one week, and all must be done within
three months of acquiring the creature. Dur-
ing the three-month period, the animal will
not harm the caster, but if the creature is left
alone for more than a week, it will revert to
its natural state and act accordingly.

The caster can use this spell to attract up
to 2 Hit Dice of animal(s) per experience
level he possesses. This is also the maximum
total Hit Dice of the animals that can be at-
tracted and trained at one time: no more
than twice the caster  s experience level.
Only unaligned animals can be attracted,
befriended, and trained.

The material components of this spell are
the caster  s holy symbol and a piece of food
the animal likes.

Bless (Conjuration/Summoning)
Reversible

Sphere: All

Range: 60 yards

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 6 rounds

Casting Time: 1 round

Area of Effect: 50-foot cube
Saving Throw: None

Upon uttering the bless spell, the caster
raises the morale of friendly creatures and
any saving throw rolls they make against
fear effects by +1. Furthermore, it raises
their attack dice rolls by +1. A blessing,

 

however, affects only those not already en-
gaged in melee combat. The caster deter-
mines at what range (up to 60 yards) he will
cast the spell. At the instant the spell is com-
pleted, it affects all creatures in a 50-foot
cube centered on the point selected by the
caster (thus, affected creatures leaving the
area are still subject to the spell  s effect;
those entering the area after the casting is
completed are not).

A second use of this spell is to bless a sin-
gle item (for example, a crossbow bolt for
use against a rakshasa). The weight of the
item is limited to one pound per caster level
and the effect lasts until the item is used or
the spell duration ends.

Multiple bless spells are not cumulative.
In addition to the verbal and somatic ges-
ture components, the bless spell requires
holy water.

This spell can be reversed by the priest to
a curse spell upon enemy creatures that
lowers their morale and attack rolls by —1.
The curse requires the sprinkling of unholy

water,

Combine (Evocation)

Sphere: All

Range: Touch

Components: V, S

Duration: Special

Casting Time: 1 round

Area of Effect: The circle of priests
Saving Throw: None

Using this spell, three to five priests com-
bine their abilities so that one of them casts
spells and turns undead at an enhanced
level. The highest level priest (or one of
them, if two or more are tied for highest)
stands alone, while the others join hands in
a surrounding circle. The central priest casts
the combine spell. He temporarily gains one
level for each priest in the circle, up to a
maximum gain of four levels. The level in-
crease affects turning undead and spell de-
tails that vary with the caster  s level. Note
that the central priest gains no additional
spells and that the group is limited to his
currently memorized spells.

The encircling priests must concentrate
on maintaining the combine effect. They
lose all Armor Class bonuses for shield and
Dexterity. If any of them has his concentra-
tion broken, the combine spell ends immedi-
ately. If the combine spell is broken while
the central priest is in the act of casting a
spell, that spell is ruined just as if the caster
was disturbed. Spells cast in combination
have the full enhanced effect, even if the
combine is broken before the duration of
the enhanced spell ends. Note that the com-
bination is not broken if only the central
caster is disturbed.
 
 

Command (Enchantment/Charm)

Sphere: Charm

Range: 30 yards
Component: V
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 1

Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the priest to command
another creature with a single word. The
command must be uttered in a language un-
derstood by the creature. The subject will
obey to the best of his/its ability only as
long as the command is absolutely clear and
unequivocal; hence, a command of “Sui-
cide!” is ignored. A command to “Die!”
causes the creature to fall in a faint or cata-
leptic state for one round, but thereafter the
creature revives and is alive and well. Typi-
cal commands are back, halt, flee, run,
stop, fall, go, leave, surrender, sleep, rest,
etc. No command affects a creature for
more than one round; undead are not af-
fected at all. Creatures with Intelligence of
13 (high) or more, or those with 6 or more
Hit Dice (or experience levels) are entitled to
a saving throw vs. spell, adjusted for Wis-
dom, (Creatures with 13 or higher Intelli-
gence and 6 Hit Dice/levels get only one
saving throw!)

Create Water (Alteration)
Reversible

Sphere: Elemental (Water)

Range: 30 yards

Components: V, S, M

Duration: Permanent

Casting Time: 1 round

Area of Effect: Up to 27 cubic feet
Saving Throw: None

When the priest casts a create water spell,
up to four gallons of water are generated for
every experience level of the caster (e.g., a
2nd-level priest creates up to eight gallons of
water, a 3rd-level up to 12 gallons, etc.).
The water is clean and drinkable (it is just
like rain water). The created water can be
dispelled within a round of its creation, oth-
erwise its magic fades, leaving normal water
that can be used, spilled, evaporated, etc.
Reversing the spell, destroy water, obliter-
ates without trace (no vapor, mist, fog, or
steam) a like quantity of water. Water can
be created or destroyed in an area as small
as will actually contain the liquid, or in an
area as large as 27 cubic feet (1 cubic yard).

The spell requires at least a drop of water
to create, or a pinch of dust to destroy, water.

Note that water can neither be created
nor destroyed within a creature. For refer-
ence purposes, water weighs about 8  /2
pounds per gallon, and a cubic foot of water
weighs approximately 64 pounds.

 

Cure Light Wounds (Necromancy)
Reversible

Sphere: Healing

Range: Touch

Components: V, S

Duration: Permanent

Casting Time: 5

Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

When casting this spell and laying his
hand upon a creature, the priest causes 148
points of wound or other injury damage to
the creature s body to be healed, This heal-
ing cannot affect creatures without corpo-
real bodies, nor can it cure wounds of
creatures not living or of extraplanar origin.

The reversed spell, cause light wounds,
operates in the same manner, inflicting 1d8
points of damage. If a creature is avoiding
this touch, an attack roll is needed to deter-
mine if the priest s hand strikes the oppo-
nent and causes such a wound.

Curing is permanent only insofar as the
creature does not sustain further damage;
caused wounds will heal—or can be cured—
just as any normal injury.

Detect Evil (Divination)
Reversible

Sphere: All

Range: 120 yards

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 1 turn + 5 rounds/level
Casting Time: 1 round

Area of Effect: 10-foot path
Saving Throw: None

This spell discovers emanations of evil, or
of good in the case of the reverse spell, from
any creature, object, or area. Character
alignment, however, is revealed only under
unusual circumstances: characters who are
strongly aligned, who do not stray from
their faith, and who are of at least 9th level
might radiate good or evil if intent upon ap-
propriate actions. Powerful monsters, such
as rakshasas or ki-rin, send forth emana-
tions of evil or good, even if polymorphed.
Aligned undead radiate evil, for it is this
power and negative force that enable them
to continue existing. An evilly cursed object
or unholy water radiates evil, but a hidden
trap or an unintelligent viper does not.

The degree of evil (faint, moderate,
strong, overwhelming) and possibly its gen-
eral nature (expectant, malignant, gloating,
etc.) can be noted. If the evil is overwhelm-
ing, the priest has a 10% chance per level of
detecting its general bent (lawful, neutral,
chaotic). The duration of a detect evil (or
detect good) spell is one turn plus five
rounds per level of the priest. Thus a priest
of 1st experience level can cast a spell with a
15-round duration, at 2nd level he can cast a
20-round duration spell, etc. The spell has a

199

Priest Spells (1st Level)

 

path of detection 10 feet wide in the direc-
tion in which the priest is facing. The priest
must concentrate—stop, have quiet, and in-
tently seek to detect the aura—for at least
one round to receive a reading.

The spell requires the use of the priest s
holy symbol as its material component,
with the priest holding it before him.

Detect Magic (Divination)
Sphere: Divination

Range; 30 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn

Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 10-foot path
Saving Throw: None

When the detect magic spell is cast, the
priest detects magical radiations in a path 10
feet wide and up to 30 yards long, in the di-
rection he is facing. The intensity of the
magic can be detected (dim, faint, moder-
ate, strong, overwhelming). The caster has
a 10% chance per level to determine the
sphere of the magic, but unlike the wizard
version of the spell, the type of magic (alter-
ation, conjuration, etc.) cannot be divined.
The caster can turn, scanning a 60° arc per
round. A stone wall of one foot or more
thickness, solid metal of one inch thickness,
or a yard or more of solid wood blocks the
spell.

The spell requires the use of the priest s
holy symbol.

Detect Poison (Divination)

Sphere: Divination

Range: 0

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4

Area of Effect: Special

Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the priest to determine
if an object has been poisoned or is poison-
ous. One object, or a 5-foot cubic mass, can
be checked per round. The priest has a 5%
chance per level of determining the exact
type of poison.

The material component is a strip of spe-
cially blessed vellum, which turns black if
poison is present.

  
Priest Spells (1st Level)

 

Detect Snares & Pits (Divination)

Sphere: Divination

Range: 0

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 4 rounds/level

Casting Time: 4

Area of Effect: 10-foot path, 40 feet long
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting this spell, the caster is able
to detect snares, pits, deadfalls and similar
hazards along a 10-foot-wide by 40-foot-
long path. Such hazards include simple pits,
deadfalls, snares of wilderness creatures
(e.g., trapdoor spiders, giant sundews, ant
lions, etc.), and primitive traps constructed
of natural materials (mantraps, missile
trips, hunting snares, etc.). The spell is
directional—the caster must face the desired
direction to determine if a pit exists or a trap
is laid in that direction. The caster experi-
ences a feeling of danger from the direction
of a detected hazard, which increases as the
danger is approached. The caster learns the
general nature of the danger (pit, snare, or
deadfall) but not its exact operation, nor
how to disarm it. Close examination, how-
ever, enables the caster to sense what
intended actions might trigger it. The spell
detects certain natural hazards—quicksand
(snare), sinkholes (pit), or unsafe walls of
natural rock (deadfall). Other hazards, such
as a cavern that floods during rain, an
unsafe construction, or a naturally poison-
ous plant, are not revealed. The spell does
not detect magical traps (save those that
operate by pit, deadfall, or snaring; see the
2nd-level spell trip and the 3rd-level spell,
snare), nor those that are mechanically
complex, nor does it detect snares or dead-
falls that have been rendered safe or inac-
tive.

The caster must have his holy symbol to
complete the spell.

Endure Cold/Endure Heat (Alteration)

Sphere: Protection

Range: Touch

Components: V, S

Duration: 1/2 hours/level
Casting Time: 1 round

Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

The creature receiving this spell is pro-
tected from normal extremes of cold or heat
(depending on which application the priest
selects at the time of casting). The creature
can stand unprotected in temperatures as
low as —30° F. or as high as 130° F,(depend-
ing on application) with no ill effect. Tem-
peratures beyond these limits inflict 1 point
of damage per hour of exposure for every
degree beyond the limit. The spell is imme-
diately cancelled if the recipient is affected
by any non-normal heat or cold, such as

 

magic, breath weapons, and so on. The can-
cellation occurs regardless of the applica-
tion and regardless of whether a heat or cold
effect hits the character (e.g., an endure cold
spell is cancelled by magical heat or fire as
well as by magical cold). The recipient of
the spell does not suffer the first 10 points of
damage (after any applicable saving
throws) from the heat or cold during the
round in which the spell is broken. The spell
ends instantly if either resist fire or resist
cold is cast upon the recipient.

Entangle (Alteration)

Sphere: Plant

Range: 80 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn

Casting Time: 4

Area of Effect: 40-foot cube
Saving Throw: ?/2

By means of this spell, the caster is able to
cause plants in the area of effect to entangle
creatures within the area. The grasses,
weeds, bushes, and even trees wrap, twist,
and entwine about the creatures, holding
them fast for the duration of the spell. Any
creature entering the area is subject to this
effect. A creature that rolls a successful sav-
ing throw vs. spell can escape the area,
moving at only 10 feet per round until out of
the area. Exceptionally large (gargantuan)
or strong creatures may suffer little or no
distress from this spell, at the DM  s option,
based on the strength of the entangling
plants.

The material component is the caster  s
holy symbol.

Faerie Fire (Alteration)

Sphere: Weather

Range: 80 yards

Component: V, M

Duration: 4 rounds/level

Casting Time: 4

Area of Effect: 10 sq. feet/level within
a 40-foot radius

Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the caster to outline one
or more objects or creatures with a pale
glowing light. The number of subjects out-
lined depends upon the number of square
feet the caster can affect. Sufficient footage
enables several objects or creatures to be
outlined by the faerie fire spell, but one
must be fully outlined before the next is
begun, and all must be within the area of
effect. Outlined objects or creatures are visi-
ble at 80 yards in the dark, 40 yards if the
viewer is near a bright light source. Out-
lined creatures are easier to strike, thus
opponents gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls in
darkness (including moonlit nights) and a
+1 bonus in twilight or better. Note that

200

 

outlining can render otherwise invisible
creatures visible. However, it cannot out-
line noncorporeal, ethereal, or gaseous
creatures. Nor does the light come any-
where close to sunlight. Therefore it has no
special effect on undead or dark-dwelling
creatures. The faerie fire can be blue, green,
or violet according to the word of the caster
at the time of casting. The faerie fire does
not cause any harm to the object or creature
thus outlined.

The material component is a small piece
of foxfire.

Invisibility to Animals (Alteration)

Sphere: Animal

Range: Touch

Components: S, M

Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4

Area of Effect: 1 creature touched/level
Saving Throw: None

When an invisibility to animals spell is
cast, the creature touched becomes totally
undetectable by normal animals with Intel-
ligences under 6. Normal animals includes
giant-sized varieties, but it excludes any
with magical abilities or powers. The
enchanted individual is able to walk among
such animals or pass through them as if he
did not exist. For example, this individual
could stand before the hungriest of lions or a
tyrannosaurus rex and not be molested or
even noticed. However, a nightmare, hell
hound, or winter wolf would certainly be
aware of the individual. For every level the
caster has achieved, one creature can be ren-
dered invisible. Any recipient attacking
while this spell is in effect ends the spell
immediately (for himself only).

The material component of this spell is
holly rubbed over the recipient.

Invisibility to Undead (Abjuration)

Sphere: Necromantic

Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 6 rounds

Casting Time: 4

Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Special

This spell causes affected undead to lose
track of and ignore the warded creature for the
duration of the spell. Undead of 4 or fewer Hit
Dice are automatically affected, but those
with more Hit Dice receive a saving throw vs.
spell to avoid the effect. Note that a priest pro-
tected by this spell cannot turn affected
undead. The spell ends immediately if the
recipient makes any attack, although casting
spells such as cure light wounds, augury, or
chant does not end the ward.

The material component is the priest s

holy symbol.

Light (Alteration)
Reversible

Sphere: Sun

Range: 120 yards

Components: V, S

Duration: 1 hour + 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 4

Area of Effect: 20-foot-radius globe
Saving Throw: Special

This spell causes a luminous glow within
20 feet of the spell  s center. The area of light
thus caused is equal in brightness to torch-
light. Objects in darkness beyond this
sphere can be seen, at best, as vague and
shadowy shapes. The spell is centered on a
point selected by the caster, and he must
have a line of sight or unobstructed path to
that point when the spell is cast. Light can
spring from air, rock, metal, wood, or
almost any similar substance. The effect is
immobile unless it is specifically centered on
a movable object or mobile creature. If this
spell is cast upon a creature, any applicable
magic resistance and saving throws must be
rolled. Successful resistance negates the
spell, while a successful saving throw indi-
cates that the spell is centered immediately
behind the creature, rather than upon the
creature itself. A light spell centered on the
visual organs of a creature blinds it, reduc-
ing its attack and saving throw rolls by 4
and worsening its Armor Class by 4. The
caster can extinguish the light at any time by
uttering a single word. Light spells are not
cumulative—multiple castings do not pro-
vide a brighter light.

The spell is reversible, causing darkness
in the same area and under the same condi-
tions as the light spell, but with half the
duration. Magical darkness is equal to that
of an unlit interior room—pitch darkness.
Any normal light source or magical light
source of lesser intensity than full daylight
does not function in magical darkness. A
darkness spell cast directly against a light
spell cancels both, and vice versa.

Locate Animals or Plants
(Divination)

Sphere: Divination (Animal, Plant)

Range: 100 yards + 20 yd./level

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 1 round/level

Casting Time: 1 round

Area of Effect: 20-foot-wide path 20 yards
long/level

Saving Throw: None

The caster can find the direction and dis-
tance of any one type of animal or plant he
desires. The caster, facing in a direction,
thinks of the animal or plant, and then
knows if any such animal or plant is within
range. If so, the exact distance and approxi-

 

mate number present is learned. During
each round of the spell  s duration, the caster
can face in only one direction, i.e., only a
20-foot-wide path can be known. The spell
lasts one round per level of experience of the
caster, while the length of the path is 100
yards plus 20 yards per level of experience.
(At the DM s option, some casters may be
able to locate only those animals [or plants]
associated closely with their own mythos.)

The material component is the caster  s
holy symbol.

While the exact chance of locating a spe-
cific type of animal or plant depends on the
details and circumstances of the locale, the
general frequency of the subject can be used
as a guideline: common = 50%, uncom-
mon = 30%, rare = 15%, and very rare =
5%. Most herbs grow in temperate regions,
while most spices grow in tropical regions.
Most plants sought as spell components or
for magical research are rare or very rare.
The results of this spell are always deter-
mined by the DM.

Magical Stone (Enchantment)

Sphere: Combat
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 4

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

By using this spell, the priest can tempo-
rarily enchant up to three small pebbles, no
larger than sling bullets. The magical stones
can then be hurled or slung at an opponent.
If hurled, they can be thrown up to 30
yards, and all three can be thrown in one
round, The character using them must roll
normally to hit, although the magic of the
stones enables any character to be proficient
with them. The stones are considered +1
weapons for determining if a creature can be
struck (those struck only by magical weap-
ons, for instance), although they do not
have an attack or damage bonus. Each stone
that hits inflicts 1d4 points of damage, 2d4
points against undead. The magic in each
stone lasts for but one-half hour or until
used.

The material components are the priest s
holy symbol and three small pebbles,
unworked by tools or magic of any type.

 

 

Pass Without Trace
(Enchantment/Charm)

Sphere: Plant

Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 1 turn/level

Casting Time: 1 round

Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the recipient can
move through any type of terrain—mud,
snow, dust, etc.—and leave neither foot-
prints nor scent. The area that is passed over
radiates magic for 1d6 turns after the affect-
ed creature passes. Thus, tracking a person
or other creature covered by this spell is
impossible by normal means. Of course,
intelligent tracking techniques, such as
using a spiral search pattern, can result in
the trackers picking up the trail at a point
where the spell has worn off.

The material component of this spell is a
sprig of pine or evergreen, which must be
burned and the ashes powdered and scat-
tered when the spell is cast.

Protection From Evil (Abjuration)
Reversible

Sphere: Protection

Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 3 rounds/level
Casting Time: 4

Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, it creates a magical
barrier around the recipient at a distance of
one foot. The barrier moves with the recipi-
ent and has three major effects:

First, all attacks made by evil or evilly
enchanted creatures against the protected
creature receive a penalty of —2 to each
attack roll, and any saving throws caused
by such attacks are made by the protected
creature with a +2 bonus.

Second, any attempt to exercise mental
control over the protected creature (if, for
example, it had been charmed by a vampire)
or to invade and take over its mind (as by a
ghost s magic jar attack) is blocked by this
spell. Note that the protection does not pre-
vent a vampire  s charm itself, nor end it, but
it does prevent the vampire from exercising
mental control through the barrier. Like-
wise, an outside life force is merely kept out,
and would not be expelled if in place before
the protection was cast.

Third, the spell prevents bodily contact
by creatures of an extraplanar or conjured
nature (such as aerial servants, elementals,
imps, invisible stalkers, salamanders, water
weirds, xorn, and others). This causes the
natural (body) weapon attacks of such crea-
tures to fail and the creature to recoil if such
Priest Spells (2nd Level)

 

attacks require touching the protected crea-
ture. Animals or monsters summoned or
conjured by spells or similar magic are like-
wise hedged from the character. This pro-
tection ends if the protected character
makes a melee attack against or tries to
force the barrier against the blocked crea-
ture.

To complete this spell, the priest uses holy
water or burning incense.

This spell can be reversed to become pro-
tection from good; the second and third
benefits remain unchanged.

The material components for the reverse
are a circle of unholy water or smoldering

dung.

Purlfy Food & Drink (Alteration)
Reversible

Sphere: All

Range: 30 yards

Components: V, S

Duration: Permanent

Casting Time: 1 round

Area of Effect: 1 cubic foot/level,
10-foot-square area

Saving Throw: None

When cast, this spell makes spoiled, rot-
ten, poisonous, or otherwise contaminated
food and water pure and suitable for eating
and drinking. Up to one cubic foot of food
and drink per level can be thus made suit-
able for consumption. This spell does not
prevent subsequent natural decay or spoil-
age. Unholy water and similar food and
drink of significance is spoiled by purify
food and drink, but the spell has no effect on
creatures of any type nor upon magical
potions,

The reverse of the spell is putrefy food
and drink. This spoils even holy water. It
likewise has no effect upon creatures or
potions.

Remove Fear (Abjuration)
Reversible

Sphere: Charm

Range: 10 yards

Components: V, S

Duration: Special

Casting Time: 1

Area of Effect: 1 creature/4 levels
Saving Throw: Special

The priest instills courage in the spell
recipient, raising the creature s saving throw
rolls against magical fear attacks by +4 for
one turn. If the recipient has recently (that
day) failed a saving throw against such an
attack, the spell immediately grants another
saving throw, with a +4 bonus to the die
roll. For every four levels of the caster, one
creature can be affected by the spell (one
creature at levels 1 through 4, two creatures

 

at levels 5 through 8, etc.).

The reverse of the spell, cause fear, causes
one creature to flee in panic at maximum
movement speed away from the caster for
1d4 rounds. A successful saving throw
against the reversed effect negates it, and
any Wisdom adjustment also applies. Of
course, cause fear can be automatically
countered by remove fear and vice versa.

Neither spell has any effect on undead of
any sort.

Sanctuary (Abjuration)

Sphere: Protection

Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 2 rounds +1 round/level
Casting Time: 4

Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

When the priest casts a sanctuary spell,
any opponent attempting to strike or other-
wise directly attack the protected creature
must roll a saving throw vs. spell. If the sav-
ing throw is successful, the opponent can
attack normally and is unaffected by that
casting of the spell. If the saving throw is
failed, the opponent loses track of and total-
ly ignores the warded creature for the dura-
tion of the spell. Those not attempting to
attack the subject remain unaffected. Note
that this spell does not prevent the opera-
tion of area attacks (fireball, ice storm,
etc.). While protected by this spell, the sub-
ject cannot take direct offensive action with-
out breaking the spell, but may use
non-attack spells or otherwise act in any
way that does not violate the prohibition
against offensive action. This allows a
warded priest to heal wounds, for example,
or to bless, perform an augury, chant, cast a
light in the area (not upon an opponent!),
and so on.

The components of the spell include the
priest s holy symbol and a small silver mir-
ror.

Shillelagh (Alteration)

Sphere: Combat, Plant

Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 2

Area of Effect: 1 normal oaken club
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the caster to change his
own oaken cudgel or unshod staff into a
magical weapon that gains a +1 bonus to its
attack roll and inflicts 2d4 points of damage
on opponents up to man-sized, and 1d4+1
points of damage on larger opponents. The
spell inflicts no damage to the staff or cud-
gel. The caster must wield the shillelagh, of
course.

The material components of this spell are
a shamrock leaf and the caster  s holy sym-
bol.

 

Second-Level Spells

Ald (Necromancy, Conjuration)

Sphere: Necromantic

Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 1 round + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5

Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

The recipient of this spell gains the benefit
of a bless spell ( +1 to attack rolls and saving
throws) and a special bonus of 1d8 addition-
al hit points for the duration of the spell.
The aid spell enables the recipient to actu-
ally have more hit points than his full nor-
mal total. The bonus hit points are lost first
when the recipient takes damage; they can-
not be regained by curative magic. Exam-
ple: A Ist-level fighter has 8 hit points,
suffers 2 points of damage (8 — 2 = 6), and
then receives an aid spell that gives 5 addi-
tional hit points. The fighter now has 11 hit
points, 5 of which are temporary. If he is
then hit for 7 points of damage, 2 normal hit
points and all 5 temporary hit points are
lost. He then receives a cure light wounds
spell that heals 4 points of damage, restor-
ing him to his original 8 hit points.

Note that the operation of the spell is
unaffected by permanent hit point losses
due to energy drain, Hit Die losses, the loss
of a familiar, or the operation of certain arti-
facts; the temporary hit point gain is figured
from the new, lower total.

The material components of this spell are
a tiny strip of white cloth with a sticky sub-
stance (such as tree sap) on the ends, plus
the priest s holy symbol.
Priest Spells (2nd Level)

 

Augury (Divination)

Sphere: Divination
Range: 0

Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2 rounds
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

The priest casting an augury spell seeks to
divine whether an action in the immediate
future (within one-half hour) will be for the
benefit of, or harmful to, the party. For
example, if a party is considering the
destruction of a weird seal that closes a por-
tal, an augury spell can be used to find if
weal or woe will be the immediate result. If
the spell is successful, the DM yields some
indication of the probable outcome: “weal,”
“woe,” or possibly a cryptic puzzle or
rhyme. The base chance for receiving a
meaningful reply is 70%, plus 1% for each
level of the priest casting the spell, e.g., 71%
at Ist level, 72% at 2nd, etc. Your DM deter-
mines any adjustments for the particular
conditions of each augury.

For example, if the question is “Will we do
well if we venture to the third level?” and a
terrible troll guarding 10,000 s.p. and a
shield +1 lurks near the entrance to the
level (which the DM estimates the party
could beat after a hard fight) the augury
might be: “Great risk brings great reward.”
If the troll is too strong for the party, the
augury might be: “Woe and destruction
await!” Likewise, a party casting several
auguries about the same action in quick suc-
cession might receive identical answers,
regardless of the dice rolls.

The material component for augury is a
set of gem-inlaid sticks, dragon bones, or
similar tokens of at least 1,000 gp value
(which are not expended in casting).

Barkskin (Alteration)

Sphere: Protection, Plant

Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5

Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

When a priest casts the barkskin spell
upon a creature, its skin becomes as tough
as bark, increasing its base Armor Class to
AC 6, plus 1 AC for every four levels of the
priest: Armor Class 5 at 4th level, Armor
Class 4 at 8th, and so on. This spell does not
function in combination with normal armor
or any magical protection. In addition, sav-
ing throw rolls vs. all attack forms except
magic gain a +1 bonus. This spell can be
placed on the caster or on any other creature
he touches.

In addition to his holy symbol, the caster

 

must have a handful of bark from an oak as
the material component of the spell.

Chant (Conjuration/Summoning)

Sphere: Combat

Range: 0

Components: V, S

Duration: Time of chanting
Casting Time: 2 rounds

Area of Effect: 30-foot radius
Saving Throw: None

By means of the chant spell, the priest
brings special favor upon himself and his
party, and causes harm to his enemies.
When the chant spell is completed, all
attack and damage rolls and saving throws
made by those in the area of effect who are
friendly to the priest gain +1 bonuses,
while those of the priest s enemies suffer —1
penalties. This bonus/penalty continues as
long as the caster continues to chant the
mystic syllables and is stationary. An inter-
ruption, however, such as an attack that
succeeds and causes damage, grappling the
chanter, or a silence spell, breaks the spell.
Multiple chants are not cumulative; how-
ever, if the 3rd-level prayer spell is spoken
while a priest of the same religious persua-
sion (not merely alignment!) is chanting, the
effect is increased to +2 and —2.

Charm Person or Mammal
(Enchantment/Charm)

Sphere: Animal

Range: 80 yards

Components: V, S

Duration: Special

Casting Time: 5

Area of Effect: 1 person or mammal
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell affects any single person or
mammal it is cast upon. The creature then
regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally
to be heeded and protected. The term per-
son includes any bipedal human, demihu-
man or humanoid of man-size or smaller,
including brownies, dryads, dwarves,
elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves,
halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans,
kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies,
sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a
10th-level fighter is included, while an ogre
is not.

The spell does not enable the caster to
control the charmed creature as if it were an
automaton, but any word or action of the
caster is viewed in the most favorable way.
Thus a charmed creature would not obey a
suicide command, but might believe the
caster if assured that the only chance to save
the caster s life is for the creature to hold
back an onrushing red dragon for “just a
round or two” and if the charmed creature s

203

 

view of the situation suggests that this
course of action still allows a reasonable
chance of survival.

The subject s attitudes and priorities are
changed with respect to the caster, but basic
personality and alignment are not, A
request that a victim make itself defenseless,
give up a valued item, or even use a charge
from a valued item (especially against form-
er associates or allies) might allow an imme-
diate saving throw to see if the charm is
thrown off. Likewise, a charmed creature
does not necessarily reveal everything it
knows or draw maps of entire areas. Any
request may be refused, if such refusal is in
character and does not directly harm the
caster. The victim s regard for the caster
does not necessarily extend to the caster  s
friends or allies. The victim does not react
well to the charmer  s allies making sugges-
tions such as, “Ask him this question...,” nor
does the charmed creature put up with ver-
bal or physical abuse from the charmer  s
associates, if this is out of character.

Note also that the spell does not empower
the caster with linguistic capabilities beyond
those he normally has. The duration of the
spell is a function of the charmed creature s
Intelligence, and it is tied to the saving
throw. The spell can be broken if a success-
ful saving throw is rolled. This saving throw
is checked on a periodic basis according to
the creature s Intelligence, even if the caster
has not overly strained the relationship.

Period Between
Intelligence Score Checks
3 or less 3 months
4to6 2 months
7to9 1 month

 

17    3 days
18 2 days
19 or more 1 day

If the caster harms, or attempts to harm,
the charmed creature by some overt action,
or if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast
upon the charmed creature, the charm is
broken automatically.

If the subject of the charm person/charm
mammal spell successfully rolls its saving
throw vs. the spell, the effect is negated.

. This spell, if used in conjunction with the
animal friendship spell, can keep the animal
near the caster  s home base, if the caster
must leave for an extended period.
 
 

Detect Charm (Divination)
Reversible

Sphere: Divination

Range: 30 yards

Components: V, S

Duration: 1 turn

Casting Time: 1 round

Area of Effect: 1 creature/round
Saving Throw: None

When used by a priest, this spell can
detect if a person or monster is under the
influence of a charm spell, or similar contro}
such as hypnosis, suggestion, beguiling,
possession, etc. The creature rolls a saving
throw vs. spell and, if successful, the caster
learns nothing about that particular crea-
ture from the casting. A caster who learns
that a creature is being influenced has a 5%
chance per level to determine the exact type
of influence. Up to 10 different creatures can
be checked before the spell wanes. If the
creature is under more than one such effect,
only the information that the charms exist is
gained. The type (since there are conflicting
emanations) is impossible to determine.

The reverse of the spell, undetectable
charm, completely masks all charms on a
single creature for 24 hours.

Dust Devil (Conjuration/Summoning)

Sphere: Elemental (Air)
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 2 rounds
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables a priest to conjure up a
weak air elemental—a dust devil of AC 4, 2
HD, MV 180 feet per round, one attack for
1d4 points of damage, which can be hit by
normal weapons. The dust devil appears as
a small whirlwind one foot in diameter at its
base, five feet tall, and three to four feet
across at the top. It moves as directed by the
priest, but dissipates if it is ever separated
from the caster by more than 30 yards. Its
winds are sufficient to put out torches, small
campfires, exposed lanterns, and other
small, open flames of non-magical origin.
The dust devil can hold a gas cloud or a
creature in gaseous form at bay or push it
away from the caster (though it cannot
damage or disperse such a cloud). If skim-
ming along the ground in an area of loose
dust, sand, or ash, the dust devil picks up
those particles and disperses them in a 10-
foot-diameter cloud centered on itself. The
cloud obscures normal vision, and creatures
caught within are blinded while inside and
for one round after they emerge. A spell-
caster caught in the dust devil or its cloud
while casting must make a saving throw vs.

Priest Spells (2nd Level)

 

spell to keep his concentration, or the spell
is ruined. Any creature native to the ele-
mental plane of Air—even another dust
devil—can disperse a dust devil with a sin-
gle hit.

Enthrall (Enchantment/Charm)

Sphere: Charm

Range: 0

Components: V, S

Duration: Special

Casting Time: 1 round

Area of Effect: 90-foot radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

A priest using this spell can enthrall an
audience that can fully understand his lan-
guage. Those in the area of effect must save
vs. spell or give the caster their undivided
attention, totally ignoring their surround-
ings. Those of a race or religion unfriendly
to the caster  s have a +4 bonus to the roll.
Any Wisdom adjustment also applies. Crea-
tures with 4 or more levels or Hit Dice, or
with a Wisdom of 16 or better, are unaffect-
ed.

To cast the spell, the caster must speak
without interruption for a full round.
Thereafter, the enchantment lasts as long as
the priest speaks, to a maximum of one
hour. Those enthralled take no action while
the priest speaks, and for 1d3 rounds there-
after while they discuss the matter. Those
entering the area of effect must also save or
become enthralled. Those not enthralled are
50% likely every turn to hoot and jeer in
unison. If there is excessive jeering, the rest
are allowed a new saving throw. The speech
ends (but the 1d3 round delay still applies) if
the priest is successfully attacked or per-
forms any action other than speaking.

If the audience is attacked, the spell
and the audience reacts immediately, rolling
a reaction check with respect to the source
of the interruption, at a penalty of —10.

Note: When handling a large number of
saving throws for similar creatures, the DM
can assume an average to save time: e.g., a
crowd of 20 men with a base saving throw
of 16 (25% success chance) will have 15 men
enthralled and five not.

Find Traps (Divination)
Sphere: Divination

Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: 3 turns

Casting Time: 5

Area of Effect: 10-foot path
Saving Throw: None

When a priest casts a find traps spell, all
traps—concealed normally or magically—
of magical or mechanical nature become
apparent to him. Note that this spell is direc-
tional, and the caster must face the desired

204

 

 
 

direction in order to determine if a trap is
laid in that particular direction.

A trap is any device or magical ward that
meets three criteria: it can inflict a sudden
or unexpected result, the spellcaster would
view the result as undesirable or harmful,
and the harmful or undesirable result was
specifically intended as such by the creator.
Thus traps include alarms, glyphs, and simi-
lar spells or devices.

The caster learns the general nature of the
trap (magical or mechanical) but not its
exact effect, nor how to disarm it. Close
examination will, however, enable the cast-
er to sense what intended actions might trig-
ger it. Note that the caster  s divination is
limited to his knowledge of what might be
unexpected and harmful. The spell cannot
predict actions of creatures (hence a con-
cealed murder hole or ambush is not a trap),
nor are natural hazards considered traps (a
cavern that floods during rain, a wall weak-
ened by age, a naturally poisonous plant). If
the DM is using specific glyphs or sigils to
identify magical wards (see the glyph of
warding spell), this spell shows the form of
the glyph or mark. The spell does not detect
traps that have been disarmed or are other-
wise inactive.

Fire Trap (Abjuration, Evocation)

Sphere: Elemental (Fire)

Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M

Duration: Permanent until discharged
Casting Time: 1 turn

Area of Effect: Object touched
Saving Throw: 1/2

Any closeable item (book, box, bottle,
chest, coffer, coffin, door, drawer, and so
forth) can be warded by a fire trap spell. The
spell is centered on a point selected by the
spellcaster. The item so trapped cannot have
a second closure or warding spell placed
upon it. A knock spell cannot affect a fire
trap in any way—as soon as the offending
party opens the item, the trap discharges.
As with most magical traps, a thief has only
half his normal find traps score to detect a
fire trap. Failure to remove it successfully
detonates it immediately. An unsuccessful
dispel magic spell will not detonate the
spell. When the trap is discharged, there will
be an explosion of five-foot radius from the
spell  s center. All creatures within this area
must roll saving throws vs. spell. Damage is
1d4 points plus 1 point per level of the cast-
er; half that total amount for creatures suc-
cessfully saving. (Underwater, this ward
inflicts half damage and creates a large
cloud of steam.) The item trapped is not
harmed by this explosion.

The caster can use the trapped object
without discharging it, as can any individ-
ual to whom the spell was specifically
Priest Spells (2nd Level)

 

attuned when cast (the method usually
involves a keyword).

To place this spell, the caster must trace
the outline of the closure with a stick of
charcoal and touch the center of the effect.
Attunement to another individual requires a
hair or similar object from the individual.

The material components are holly ber-
ries.

Flame Blade (Evocation)

Sphere: Elemental (Fire)

Range: 0

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round/2 levels
Casting Time: 4

Area of Effect: 3   long, sword-like blade
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the caster causes a blazing
ray of red-hot fire to spring forth from his
hand, This blade-like ray is wielded as if it
were a scimitar. If the caster successfully hits
with the flame blade in melee combat, the
creature struck suffers 1d4 + 4 points of
damage, with a damage bonus of +2 (i.e.,
7-10 points) if the creature is undead or is
especially vulnerable to fire. If the creature
is protected from fire, the damage inflicted
is reduced by 2 (i.e., 1d4 + 2 points). Fire
dwellers and those using fire as an innate
attack form suffer no damage from the
spell. The flame blade can ignite combusti-
ble materials such as parchment, straw, dry
sticks, cloth, etc. However, it is not a magi-
cal weapon in the normal sense of the term,
so creatures (other than undead) struck only
by magical weapons are not harmed by it.
This spell does not function underwater.

In addition to the caster  s holy symbol,
the spell requires a leaf of sumac as a materi-
al component.

Goodberry (Alteration, Evocation)
Reversible

Sphere: Plant

Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 day + 1 day/level
Casting Time: 1 round

Area of Effect: 2d4 fresh berries
Saving Throw: None

Casting a goodberry spell upon a handful
of freshly picked berries makes 2d4 of them
magical. The caster (as well as any other
caster of the same faith and 3rd or higher
level) can immediately discern which berries
are affected. A detect magic spell discovers
this also. Berries with the magic either
enable a hungry creature of approximately
man-size to eat one and be as well-
nourished as if a full normal meal were eat-
en, or else cure 1 point of physical damage
from wounds or other similar causes, sub-

 

ject toa maximum of 8 points of such curing
in any 24-hour period.

The reverse of the spell, badberry, causes
2d4 rotten berries to appear wholesome, but
each actually delivers 1 point of poison
damage (no saving throw) if ingested.

The material component of the spell is the
caster  s holy symbol passed over the freshly
picked, edible berries to be enspelled (blue-
berries, blackberries, raspberries, currants,
gooseberries, etc.).

Heat Metal (Alteration)
Reversible

Sphere: Elemental (Fire)
Range: 40 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 7 rounds
Casting Time: 5

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

By means of the heat metal spell, the cast-
er is able to make ferrous metal (iron, iron
alloys, steel) extremely hot. Elven chain
mail is not affected, and magical metal
armor receives an item saving throw vs.
magical fire. If this is successful, the heat
metal spell does not affect it.

On the first round of the spell, the metal
merely becomes very warm and uncomfor-
table to touch (this is also the effect on the
last melee round of the spell  s duration).
During the second and sixth (next to the
last) rounds, heat causes blisters and dam-
age; in the third, fourth, and fifth rounds,
the metal becomes searing hot, causing
damage to exposed flesh, as shown below:

Metal Temperature Damage per Round

very warm none
hot 1d4 points
searing” 2d4 points

(*) On the final round of searing, the
afflicted creature must roll a successful sav-
ing throw vs. spell or suffer one of the fol-
lowing disabilities: hand or foot—unusable
for 2d4 days, body—disabled 1d4 days,
head—unconscious 1d4 turns. This effect
can be completely removed by the Sth-level
priest heal spell or by normal rest.

Note also that materials such as wood,
leather, or flammable cloth smolder and
burn if exposed to searing hot metal. Such
materials cause searing damage to exposed
flesh on the next round, Fire resistance
(spell, potion, or ring) or a protection from
fire spell totally negates the effects of a heat
metal spell, as does immersion in water or
snow, or exposure to a cold or ice storm
spell. This version of the spell does not func-
tion underwater. For every two experience
levels of the caster, the metal of one man-
sized creature can be affected (i.e., arms and

205

 

armor, or a single mass of metal equal to 50
pounds weight). Thus, a 3rd-level caster
would affect one such creature, a 4th- or
5th-level caster two, etc.

The reverse of the spell, chill metal,
counters a heat metal spell or else causes
metal to act as follows:

Metal Temperature Damage per Round

cold none
icy 1-2 hit points
freezing* 1d4 hit points

(*) On the final round of freezing, the
afflicted creature must roll a successful sav-
ing throw vs. spell or suffer from the numb-
ing effects of the cold. This causes the loss of
all feeling in a hand (or hands, if the DM
tules the saving throw was failed badly) for
1d4 days. During this time, the character s
grip is extremely weak and he cannot use
that hand for fighting or any other activity
requiring a firm grasp.

The chill metal spell is countered by a
resist cold spell, or by any great heat—
proximity to a blazing fire (not a mere
torch), a magical flaming sword, a wall of
fire spell, etc. Underwater, this version of
the spell inflicts no damage, but ice immedi-
ately forms around the affected metal,
exerting an upward buoyancy.

Hold Person (Enchantment/Charm)

Sphere: Charm
Range: 120 yards
Components, V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1d4 persons

in a 20-foot cube
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell holds 1d4 humans, demihu-
mans, or humanoid creatures rigidly immo-
bile and in place for five or more rounds.

The hold person spell affects any bipedal
human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-
size or smaller, including brownies, dryads,
dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins,
half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins,
humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs,
pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others.
Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be held,
while an ogre could not.

The effect is centered on a point selected
by the caster, and it affects persons selected
by the caster within the area of effect. If the
spell is cast at three persons, each gets a nor-
mal saving throw; if only two persons are
being enspelled, each rolls his saving throw
with a —1 penalty; if the spell is cast at but
one person, the saving throw die roll suffers
—2 penalty. Saving throws are adjusted for
Wisdom. Those who succeed on their sav-
ing throws are totally unaffected by the
spell. Undead creatures cannot be held.
Priest Spells (2nd Level)

 

Held creatures cannot move or speak, but
they remain aware of events around them
and can use abilities not requiring motion or
speech. Being held does not prevent the
worsening of the subjects   condition due to
wounds, disease, or poison. The priest cast-
ing the hold person spell can end the spell
with a single utterance at any time; other-
wise the duration is two rounds at Ist level,
four rounds at 2nd level, six rounds at 3rd
level, etc.

The spellcaster needs a small, straight
piece of iron as the material component of
this spell.

Know Alignment (Divination)
Reversible

Sphere: Divination

Range: 10 yards

Components: V, S

Duration: 1 turn

Casting time: 1 round

Area of Effect: 1 creature or object
Saving Throw: Neg.

A know alignment spell enables the priest
to exactly read the aura of a creature or an
aligned object (unaligned objects reveal
nothing). The caster must remain stationary
and concentrate on the subject for a full
round. If the creature rolls a successful sav-
ing throw vs. spell, the caster learns nothing
about that particular creature from the cast-
ing. Certain magical devices negate the
power of the know alignment spell.

The reverse, undetectable alignment,
conceals the alignment of an object or crea-
ture for 24 hours.

Messenger (Enchantment/Charm)

Sphere: Animal

Range: 20 yards/level
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 day/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell enables the priest to call upon a
tiny (size T) creature of at least animal intel-
ligence to act as his messenger. The spell
does not affect giant animals and it does not
work on creatures of low (i.e., 5) Intelli-
gence or higher. If the creature is within
range, the priest, using some type of food
desirable to the animal as a lure, can call the
animal to come. The animal is allowed a
saving throw vs. spell. If the saving throw is
failed, the animal advances toward the
priest and awaits his bidding. The priest can
communicate with the animal in a crude
fashion, telling it to go to a certain place,
but directions must be simple. The spell-
caster can attach some small item or note to
the animal. If so instructed, the animal will

 

then wait at that location until the duration
of the spell expires. (Note that unless the in-
tended recipient of a message is expecting a
messenger in the form of a small animal or
bird, the carrier may be ignored.) When the
spell s duration expires, the animal or bird
returns to its normal activities. The in-
tended recipient of a message gains no com-
munication ability.

Obscurement (Alteration)

Sphere: Weather

Range: 0

Components: V, S
Duration; 4 rounds/level
Casting Time: 5

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes a misty vapor to arise
around the caster. It persists in this locale
for four rounds per caster level and reduces
the visibility ranges of all types of vision (in-
cluding infravision) to 2d4 feet. The ground
area affected by the spell is a square progres-
sion based on the caster  s level: a 10   x 10  
area at Ist level, a 20  x 20   area at 2nd
level, a 30   x 30   area at 3rd level, and so on.
The height of the vapor is restricted to 10
feet, although the cloud will otherwise ex-
pand to fill confined spaces. A strong wind
(such as the 3rd-level wizard spell, gust of
wind, can cut the duration of an obscure-
ment spell by 75%. This spell does not func-
tion under water.

Produce Flame (Alteration)

Sphere: Elemental (Fire)
Range: 0

Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

A bright flame, equal in brightness to a
torch, springs forth from the caster  s palm
when he casts a produce flame spell. The
flame does not harm the caster, but it is hot
and it causes the combustion of flammable
materials (paper, cloth, dry wood, oil, etc.).
The caster is capable of hurling the magical
flame as a missile, with a range of 40 yards
(considered short range). The flame flashes
on impact, igniting combustibles within a
three-foot diameter of its center of impact,
and then it goes out. A creature struck by
the flame suffers 1d4+1 points of damage
and, if combustion occurs, must spend a
round extinguishing the fire or suffer addi-
tional damage assigned by the DM until the
fire is extinguished. A miss is resolved as a
grenade-like missile. If any duration re-
mains to the spell, another flame immedi-
ately appears in the caster  s hand. The caster
can hurl a maximum of one flame per level,

206

 

but no more than one flame per round.

The caster can snuff out magical flame
any time he desires, but fire caused by the
flame cannot be so extinguished. This spell
does not function under water.

Resist Fire/Resist Cold (Alteration)

Sphere: Protection

Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5

Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is placed upon a creature
by a priest, the creature s body is toughened
to withstand heat or cold, as chosen by the
caster. Complete immunity to mild condi-
tions (standing naked in the snow or reach-
ing into an ordinary fire to pluck out a note)
is gained. The recipient can somewhat resist
intense heat or cold (whether natural or
magical in origin), such as red-hot charcoal,
a large amount of burning oil, flaming
swords, fire storms, fireballs, meteor
swarms, red dragon s breath, frostbrand
swords, ice storms, wands of frost, or white
dragon s breath. In all of these cases, the
temperature affects the creature to some ex-
tent. The recipient of the spell gains a bonus
of +3 to saving throws against such attack
forms and all damage sustained is reduced
by 50%; therefore, if the saving throw is
failed, the creature sustains one-half dam-
age, and if the saving throw is successful,
only one-quarter damage is sustained. Re-
sistance to fire lasts for one round for each
experience level of the priest placing the
spell.

The caster needs a drop of mercury as the
material component of this spell.

Silence, 15   Radius (Alteration)

Sphere: Guardian

Range: 120 yards

Components: V, S

Duration: 2 rounds/level

Casting Time: 5

Area of Effect: 15-foot-radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting this spell, complete silence
prevails in the affected area. All sound is
stopped: conversation is impossible, spells
cannot be cast (or at least not those with
verbal components, if the optional compo-
nent rule is used), and no noise whatsoever
issues from or enters the area. The spell can
be cast into the air or upon an object, but
the effect is stationary unless cast on a mo-
bile object or creature. The spell lasts two
rounds for each level of experience of the
priest. The spell can be centered upon a
creature, and the effect then radiates from
the creature and moves as it moves. An un-
Priest Spells (2nd Level)

 

willing creature receives a saving throw
against the spell. If the saving throw is suc-
cessful, the spell effect is centered about one
foot behind the position of the subject crea-
ture at the instant of casting. This spell pro-
vides a defense against sound-based attacks,
such as harpy singing, horn of blasting, etc.

Slow Poison (Necromancy)

Sphere: Healing

Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 1 hour/level

Casting Time: 1

Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

Wher this spell is placed upon a poisoned
individual, it greatly slows the effects of
venom, if it is cast upon the victim before
the poison takes full effect. (This period,
known as the onset time, is known to the
DM.) While this spell does not neutralize
the venom, it does prevent it from substan-
tially harming the individual for the dura-
tion of its magic in hopes that, during that
period, a full cure can be accomplished.

The material components of the slow poi-
son spell are the priest s holy symbol and a
bud of garlic that must be crushed and
smeared on the wound (or eaten if poison
was ingested).

Snake Charm (Enchantment/Charm)

Sphere: Animal

Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: Special

Casting Time: 5

Area of Effect: 30-foot cube
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, a hypnotic pattern
is set up that causes one or more snakes to
cease all activity except a semi-erect, swaying
movement. If the snakes are charmed while
in a torpor, the duration of the spell is 1d4 +2
turns; if the snakes are not torpid, but are not
aroused and angry, the charm lasts 1d3 turns;
if the snakes are angry or attacking, the
snake charm spell lasts 1d4+4 rounds. The
priest casting the spell can charm snakes
whose total hit points are less than or equal
to those of the priest. On the average, a Ist-
level priest could charm snakes with a total
of 4 or 5 hit points; a 2nd-level priest could
charm 9 hit points, etc. The hit points can be
those of a single snake or those of several of
the reptiles, but the total hit points cannot ex-
ceed those of the priest casting the spell. A
23-hit point caster charming a dozen 2-hit
point snakes would charm 11 of them. This
spell is also effective against any ophidian or
ophidianoid monster, such as naga, couatl,
etc., subject to magic resistance, hit points,
and so forth.

 

Variations of this spell may exist, allow-
ing other creatures significant to a particular
mythos to be affected. Your DM will inform
you if such spells exist.

Speak With Animals (Alteration)

Sphere: Animal, Divination

Range: 0

Components: V, S

Duration: 2 rounds/level

Casting Time: 5

Area of Effect: 1 animal within
30-foot radius of priest

Saving Throw: None

This spell empowers the priest to compre-
hend and communicate with any warm- or
cold-blooded normal or giant animal that is
not mindless. The priest is able to ask ques-
tions and receive answers of the creature, al-
though friendliness and cooperation are by
no means assured. Furthermore, terseness
and evasiveness are likely in basically wary
and cunning creatures (the more stupid ones
will instead make inane comments). If the
animal is friendly or of the same general
alignment as the priest, there is a possibility
that the animal will do some favor or service
for the priest. This possibility is determined
by the DM, Note that this spell differs from
the speak with monsters spell, for this spell
allows conversation only with normal or gi-
ant, non-fantastic creatures such as apes,
bears, cats, dogs, elephants, and so on.

Spiritual Hammer (Invocation)

Sphere: Combat

Range: 10 yards/level

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5

Area of Effect: Special

Saving Throw: None

By calling upon his deity, the caster of a
spiritual hammer spell brings into existence
a field of force shaped vaguely like a ham-
mer. As long as the caster concentrates upon
the hammer, it strikes at any opponent
within its range, as desired. Each round the
caster can choose to attack the same target
as the previous round or switch to a new tar-
get that he can see anywhere within his max-
imum range. The spiritual hammer  s chance
to successfully hit is equal to that of the
caster, without any Strength bonuses. In ad-
dition, it strikes as a magical weapon with a
bonus of +1 for every six experience levels
(or fraction) of the spellcaster, up to a total
of +3 to the attack roll and +3 to the dam-
age roll for a 13th-level caster. The base
damage inflicted when it scores a hit is ex-
actly the same as a normal war hammer
(1d4+1 vs. opponents of man size or
smaller, 1d4 upon larger opponents, plus
the magical bonus). The hammer strikes in

207

 

the same direction as the caster is facing, so
if he is behind the target, all bonuses for rear
attack are gained along with the loss of any
modifications to the target s AC for shield
and Dexterity.

As soon as the caster ceases concentra-
tion, the spiritual hammer spell ends. A dis-
pel magic spell that includes either the caster
or the force in its area of effect has a chance
to dispel the spiritual hammer. If an at-
tacked creature has magic resistance, the re-
sistance is checked the first time the spiritual
hammer strikes. If the hammer is success-
fully resisted, the spell is lost. If not, the
hammer has its normal full effect for the du-
ration of the spell.

The material component of this spell is a
normal war hammer that the priest must
hurl toward opponents while uttering a plea
to his deity. The hammer disappears when
the spell is cast.

Trip (Enchantment/Charm)

Sphere: Plant

Range: Touch

Components: V, S

Duration: 1 turn/level

Casting Time: 5

Area of Effect: 1 object up to 10 feet long
Saving Throw: Neg.

This magic must be cast upon a normal
object—a length of vine, a stick, a pole, a
rope, or a similar object. The spell causes
the object to rise slightly off the ground or
floor it is resting on to trip most creatures
crossing it, if they fail their saving throws
vs. spell. Note that only as many creatures
can be tripped as are actually stepping
across the enchanted object. Thus a three-
foot-long piece of rope could trip only one
man-sized creature, Creatures moving at a
very rapid pace (running) when tripped suf-
fer 1 point of damage and are stunned for
1d4 +1 rounds if the surface they fall upon is
very hard (if it is turf or other soft material,
they are merely stunned for the rest of that
round). Very large creatures, such as ele-
phants, are not at all affected by a trip. The
object continues to trip all creatures passing
over it, including the spellcaster, for as long
as the spell duration lasts. A creature aware
of the object and its potential adds a +4 bo-
nus to its saving throw roll when crossing
the object. The enchanted object is 80% un-
detectable unless a means that detects magi-
cal traps is employed or the operation of the
spell is observed. This spell does not func-
tion under water.
  

Warp Wood (Alteration)
Reversible

Sphere: Plant

Range: 10 yards/level
Components: V, S
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 5

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

When this spell is cast, the priest causes a
volume of wood to bend and warp, perma-
nently destroying its straightness, form, and
strength. The range of a warp wood spell is
10 yards for each level of experience of the
caster. It affects approximately a 15-inch
shaft of wood of up to one-inch diameter
per level of the caster. Thus, at Ist level, a
caster might be able to warp an hand axe
handle or four crossbow bolts; at Sth level,
he could warp the shaft of a typical spear.
Note that boards or planks can also be af-
fected, causing a door to be sprung or a boat
or ship to leak. Warped missile weapons are
useless; warped melee weapons suffer a —4
penalty to their attack rolls.

Enchanted wood is affected only if the
spellcaster is of higher level than the caster
of the prior enchantment. The spellcaster
has a 20% cumulative chance of success per
level of difference (20% if one level higher,
40% if two levels higher, etc.). Thus, a door
magically held or wizard locked by a Sth-
level wizard is 40% likely to be affected by a
warp wood spell cast by a 7th-level priest.
Wooden magical items are considered en-
chanted at 12th level (or better). Extremely
powerful items, such as artifacts, are unaf-
fected by this spell.

The reversed spell, straighten wood,
straightens bent or crooked wood, or re-
verses the effects of a warp wood spell, sub-
ject to the same restrictions.

Withdraw (Alteration)

Sphere: Protection
Range: 0

Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5

Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

By means of a withdraw spell, the priest
in effect alters the flow of time with regard
to himself. While but one round of time
passes for those not affected by the spell, the
priest is able to spend two rounds, plus one
round per level, in contemplation. Thus, a
Sth-level priest can withdraw for seven
rounds to cogitate on some matter while one
round passes for all others. (The DM should
allow the player one minute of real time per
round withdrawn to ponder some problem
or question. No discussion with other play-

Priest Spells (3rd Level)

 

ers is permitted.) Note that while affected
by the withdraw spell, the caster can use
only the following spells: any divination
spell or any curing or healing spell, the latter
on himself only. The casting of any of these
spells in a different fashion (e.g., a cure light
wounds spell bestowed upon a companion)
negates the withdraw spell. Similarly, the
withdrawn caster cannot walk or run, be-
come invisible, or engage in actions other
than thinking, reading, and the like. He can
be affected by the actions of others, losing
any Dexterity or shield bonus. Any success-
ful attack upon the caster breaks the spell.

Wyvern Watch (Evocation)

Sphere: Guardian

Range: 30 yards

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 8 hours or until strike
Casting Time: 5

Area of Effect: 10-foot-radius sphere
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell is known as wyvern watch be-
cause of the insubstantial haze brought
forth by its casting, which vaguely resem-
bles a wyvern. It is typically used to guard
some area against intrusion. Any creature
approaching within 10 feet of the guarded
area may be affected by the “wyvern.” Any
creature entering the guarded area must roll
a successful saving throw vs. spell or stand
paralyzed for one round per level of the
caster, until freed by the spellcaster, by a
dispel magic spell, or by a remove paralysis
spell. A successful saving throw indicates
that the subject creature was missed by the
attack of the wyvern-form, and the spell re-
mains in place. As soon as a subject creature
is successfully struck by the wyvern-form,
the paralysis takes effect and the force of the
spell dissipates. The spell force likewise dis-
sipates if no intruder is struck by the
wyvern-form for eight hours after the spell
is cast. Any creature approaching the space
being guarded by the wyvern-form may be
able to detect its presence before coming
close enough to be attacked; this chance of
detection is 90% in bright light, 30% in twi-
light conditions, and 0% in darkness.

The material component is the priest s
holy symbol.

Third-Level Spells

Animate Dead (Necromancy)

Sphere: Necromantic
Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration; Permanent
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates the lowest of the undead
monsters, skeletons or zombies, usually
from the bones or bodies of dead humans,
demihumans, or humanoids. The spell
causes these remains to become animated
and obey the simple verbal commands of
the caster, regardless of how they communi-
cated in life. The skeletons or zombies can
follow the caster, remain in an area and at-
tack any creature (or just a specific type of
creature) entering the place, etc. The un-
dead remain animated until they are de-
stroyed in combat or are turned; the magic
cannot be dispelled.

The priest can animate one skeleton or
one zombie for each experience level he has
attained. If creatures with more than 1+ Hit
Dice are animated, the number is deter-
mined by the monster Hit Dice. Skeletal
forms have the Hit Dice of the original crea-
ture, while zombie forms have 1 more Hit
Die. Thus, a 12th-level priest could animate
12 dwarven skeletons (or six zombies), four
zombie gnolls, or a single zombie fire giant.
Note that this is based on the standard racial
Hit Die norm; thus, a high-level adventurer
would be animated as a skeleton or zombie
of 1 or 2 Hit Dice, and without special class
or racial abilities. The caster can, alterna-
tively, animate two small animal skeletons
(1-1 Hit Die or less) for every level of experi-
ence he has achieved.

The spell requires a drop of blood, a piece
of flesh of the type of creature being ani-
mated, and a pinch of bone powder or a
bone shard to complete the spell. Casting
 

this spell is not a good act, and only evil
priests use it frequently.

Call Lightning (Alteration)

Sphere: Weather

Range: 0

Components: V, S

Duration: 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 1 turn

Area of Effect: 360-foot radius
Saving Throw: */2

When a call lightning spell is cast, there
must be a storm of some sort in the area—a
rain shower, clouds and wind, hot and
cloudy conditions, or even a tornado
(including a whirlwind formed by a djinn or
air elemental of 7 Hit Dice or more). The
caster is then able to call down bolts of light-
ning. The caster can call down one bolt per
turn. The caster need not call a bolt of light-
ning immediately—other actions, even
spellcasting, can be performed; however,
the caster must remain stationary and con-
centrate for a full round each time a bolt is
called. The spell has a duration of one turn
per caster level. Each bolt causes 2d8 points
of electrical damage, plus an additional 1d8
points for each of the caster  s experience
levels. Thus, a 4th-level caster calls down a
6d8 bolt (2d8 + 4d8).

The bolt of lightning flashes down in a
vertical stroke at whatever distance the
spellcaster decides, up to 360 yards away.
Any creature within a 10-foot radius of the
path or the point where the lightning strikes
suffers full damage unless a successful sav-
ing throw vs. spell is rolled, in which case
only one-half damage is taken.

Because it requires a storm overhead, this
spell can only be used outdoors. It does not
function under ground or under water.

Continual Light (Alteration)
Reversible

Sphere: Sun

Range: 120 yards

Components: V, S

Duration: Permanent

Casting Time: 6

Area of Effect: 60-foot-radius globe
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is similar to a light spell, except
that it is as bright as full daylight and lasts
until negated by magical darkness or by a
dispel magic spell. Creatures with penalties
in bright light suffer them in this spell  s area
of effect. As with the light spell, this can be
cast into air, onto an object, or at a creature.
In the third case, the continual light affects
the space about one foot behind a creature
that successfully rolls its saving throw vs.
spell (a failed saving throw means the con-
tinual light is centered on the creature and

 

Priest Spells (3rd Level)

moves as it moves). Note that this spell also
blinds a creature if it is successfully cast
upon the creature s visual organs. If the spell
is cast on a small object that is then placed in
a light-proof covering, the spell effects are
blocked until the covering is removed.

Continual light brought into an area of
magical darkness (or vice versa) cancels the
darkness so that the otherwise prevailing
light conditions exist in the overlapping
areas of effect. A direct casting of a contin-
ual light spell against a similar or weaker
magical darkness cancels both.

This spell eventually consumes the mate-
rial it is cast upon, but the process takes far
longer than the time in a typical campaign.
Extremely hard and expensive materials
might last hundreds or even thousands of
years.

The reverse spell, continual darkness,
causes complete absence of light (pitch
blackness), similar to the darkness spell but
of greater duration and area.

Create Food & Water (Alteration)
Sphere: Creation

Range: 10 yards

Components: V, S

Duration: Special

Casting Time: 1 turn

Area of Effect: 1 cubic foot/level
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the priest causes
food and water to appear. The food thus
created is highly nourishing if rather bland;
each cubic foot of the material sustains three
human-sized creatures or one horse-sized
creature for a full day. The food decays and
becomes inedible within 24 hours, although
it can be restored for another 24 hours by
casting a purify food and water spell upon
it. The water created by this spell is the same
as that created by the 1st-level priest spell
create water. For each experience level the
priest has attained, one cubic foot of food or
water is created by the spell. A 2nd-level
priest could create one cubic foot of food
and one cubic foot of water.

Cure Blindness or Deafness
(Abjuration)
Reversible

Sphere: Necromantic
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Special
By touching the creature afflicted, the
priest employing the spell can permanently
cure some forms of blindness or deafness.
This spell does not restore or repair visual or

209

 

auditory organs damaged by injury or dis-
ease.

Its reverse, cause blindness or deafness,
requires a successful touch (successful
attack roll) on the victim. If the victim rolls
a successful saving throw, the effect is
negated. If the saving throw is failed, a non-
damaging magical blindness or deafness
results.

A deafened creature suffers a —1 penalty
to surprise rolls, a +1 penalty to its initia-
tive rolls, a 20% chance of spell failure for
spells with verbal components, and can
react only to what it can see or feel. A blind-
ed creature suffers a — 4 penalty to its attack
rolls, a +4 penalty to its Armor Class, anda
+2 penalty to its initiative rolls.

Cure Disease (Abjuration)
Reversible

Sphere: Necromantic

Range: Touch

Components: V, S

Duration; Permanent

Casting Time: 1 round

Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the caster to cure most
diseases by placing his hand upon the dis-
eased creature. The affliction rapidly disap-
pears thereafter, making the cured creature
whole and well in from one turn to 10 days,
depending on the type of disease and the
state of its advancement when the cure took
place. (The DM must adjudicate these con-
ditions.) The spell is also effective against
parasitic monsters such as green slime, rot
grubs, and others. When cast by a priest of
at least 12th level, this spell cures lycanthro-
py if cast within three days of the infection.
Note that the spell does not prevent reoccur-
rence of a disease if the recipient is again
exposed.

The reverse of the cure disease spell is
cause disease. To be effective, the priest
must touch the intended victim, and the vic-
tim must fail a saving throw vs. spell. The
severity of the disease is decided by the
priest (debilitating or fatal). The exact
details of the disease are decided by the DM,
but the following are typical:

* Debilitating—The disease takes effect in
1d6 turns, after which the creature loses 1
point of Strength per hour until his Strength
is reduced to 2 or less, at which time the
recipient is weak and virtually helpless. If a
creature has no Strength rating, it loses 10%
of its hit points per Strength loss, down to
10% of its original hit points. If the disease
also affects hit points, use the more severe
penalty. Recovery requires a period of 1d3
weeks.

* Fatal—This wasting disease is effective
immediately. Infected creatures receive no
benefit from cure wound spells while the
Priest Spells (3rd Level)

 

disease is in effect; wounds heal at only 10%
of the natural rate. The disease proves fatal
within 1d6 months and can be cured only by
magical means. Each month the disease pro-
gresses, the creature loses 2 points of Cha-
risma, permanently.

The inflicted disease can be cured by the
cure disease spell. Lycanthropy cannot be
caused.

Dispel Magic (Abjuration)

Sphere: Protection

Range: 60 yards

Components: V, S

Duration: Special

Casting Time: 6

Area of Effect: 30-foot cube or 1 item
Saving Throw: None

When a priest casts this spell, it has a
chance to neutralize or negate the magic it
comes in contact with as follows:

First, it has a chance to remove spells and
spell-like effects (including device effects
and innate abilities) from creatures or
objects. Second, it may disrupt the casting
or use of these in the area of effect at the
instant the dispel is cast. Third, it may
destroy magical potions (which are treated
as 12th level for purposes of this spell).

Each effect or potion in the spell  s area is
checked to determine if it is dispelled. The
caster can always dispel his own magic; oth-
erwise the chance depends on the difference
in level between the magical effect and the
caster. The base chance of successfully dis-
pelling is 11 or higher on 1d20. If the caster
is higher level than the creator of the effect
to be dispelled, the difference is subtracted
from this base number needed. If the caster
is lower level, then the difference is added to
the base. A die roll of 20 always succeeds
and a die roll of 1 always fails. Thus, if a
caster is 10 levels higher than the magic he is
trying to dispel, only a roll of 1 prevents the
effect from being dispelled.

A dispel magic can affect only a specially
enchanted item (such as a magical scroll,
ring, wand, rod, staff, miscellaneous item,
weapon, shield, or armor) if it is cast
directly upon the item. This renders the item
nonoperational for 1d4 rounds. An item
possessed or carried by a creature has the
creature s saving throw against this effect;
otherwise it is automatically rendered non-
operational. An interdimensional interface
(such as a bag of holding) rendered non-
operational is temporarily closed. Note that
an item  s physical properties are unchanged:
a nonoperational magical sword is still a
sword.

Artifacts and relics are not subject to this
spell, but some of their spell-like effects may
be, at the DM s option.

descriptions.

Feign Death (Necromancy)

Sphere: Necromantic

Range: Touch

Component: V

Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1/2

Area of Effect: Person touched
Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the caster or any
other willing person can be put into a cata-
leptic state that is impossible to distinguish
from actual death. Although the person
affected can smell, hear, and know what is
going on, no feeling or sight of any sort is
possible; thus, any wounding or mistreat-
ment of the body is not felt, no reaction
occurs, and damage is only one-half nor-
mal. In addition, paralysis, poison, or
energy level drain does not affect a person
under the influence of this spell, but poison
injected or otherwise introduced into the
body becomes effective when the spell recip-
ient is no longer under the influence of this
spell, although a saving throw is permitted.
However, the spell offers no protection
from causes of certain death—being crushed
under a landslide, etc. Only a willing indi-
vidual can be affected by a feign death spell.
The priest is able to end the spell effect at
any time, but it requires a full round for
bodily functions to begin again.

Note that, unlike the wizard version of
this spell, only people can be affected, and
that those of any level can be affected by the
priest casting this spell.

Flame Walk (Alteration)

Sphere: Elemental (Fire)

Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 1 round + 1/level
Casting Time: 5

Area of Effect: Creature(s) touched
Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the caster
empowers one or more creatures to with-
stand nonmagical fires of temperatures up
to 2,000° F. (enabling them to walk upon
molten lava). It also confers a +2 bonus to
saving throws against magical fire and
reduces damage from such fires by one-half,
even if the saving throw is failed. For every
experience level above the minimum
required to cast the spell (Sth), the priest can
affect an additional creature. This spell is
not cumulative with resist fire spells or simi-
lar protections.

The material components of the spell are
the priest s holy symbol and at least 500 gp
of powdered ruby per affected creature.

Glyph of Warding
(Abjuration, Evocation)

Sphere: Guardian

Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M

Duration: Permanent until discharged
Casting Time: Special

Area of Effect: Special

Saving Throw: Special

A glyph of warding is a powerful inscrip-
tion magically drawn to prevent unauthor-
ized or hostile creatures from passing,
entering, or opening. It can be used to guard
asmall bridge, to ward an entry, or asa trap
on a chest or box.

The priest must set the conditions of the
ward; typically any creature violating the
warded area without speaking the name of
the glyph is subject to the magic it stores. A
successful saving throw vs. spell enables the
creature to escape the effects of the glyph.
Glyphs can be set according to physical
characteristics, such as creature type, size,
and weight. Glyphs can also be set with
respect to good or evil, or to pass those of
the caster  s religion. They cannot be set
 

according to class, Hit Dice, or level. Multi-
ple glyphs cannot be cast on the same area;
although if a cabinet had three drawers,
each could be separately warded.

When the spell is cast, the priest weaves a
tracery of faintly glowing lines around the
warding sigil. For every five square feet of
area to be protected, one round is required
to trace the warding lines of the glyph. The
caster can affect an area equal to a square
the sides of which are the same as his level,
in feet. The glyph can be placed to conform
to any shape up to the limitations of the
caster  s total square footage. Thus a 6th-
level caster could place a glyph on a 6   x 6  
square, shape it into a rectangle 4  x 9  , a
band 2   by 18  , or a single strip 1   by 36  .
When the spell is completed, the glyph and
tracery become invisible.

The priest traces the glyph with incense,
which, if the area exceeds 50 square feet,
must be sprinkled with powdered diamond
(at least 2,000 gp worth).

Typical glyphs shock for 1d4 points of
electrical damage per level of the spellcaster,
explode for a like amount of fire damage,
paralyze, blind, deafen, and so forth. The
DM may allow any harmful priest spell
effect to be used as a glyph, provided the
caster is of sufficient level to cast the spell.
Successful saving throws either reduce
effects by one-half or negate them, accord-
ing to the glyph employed. Glyphs cannot
be affected or bypassed by such means as
physical or magical probing, though they
can be dispelled by magic and foiled by
high-level thieves using their find-and-
remove-traps skill.

The DM may decide that the exact glyphs
available to a priest depend on his religion,
and he might make new glyphs available
according to the magical research rules.

Hold Animal (Enchantment/Charm)

Sphere: Animal

Range: 80 yards

Components: V, S

Duration: 2 rounds/level

Casting Time: 6

Area of Effect: 1 to 4 animals in a
40-foot cube

Saving Throw: Neg.

By means of this spell, the caster holds
one to four animals rigid. Animals affected
are normal or giant-sized mammals, birds,
or reptiles, but not monsters such as cen-
taurs, gorgons, harpies, naga, etc. Apes,
bears, crocodiles, dogs, eagles, foxes, giant
beavers, and similar animals are subject to
this spell. The hold lasts for two rounds per
caster level. The caster decides how many
animals can be affected, but the greater the
number, the better chance each has to suc-
cessfully save against the spell. Each animal
gets a saving throw: if only one is the subject

 

Priest Spells (3rd Level)

of the spell, it has a penalty of —4 to its roll;
if two are subject, each receives a penalty of
—2 to its roll; if three are subject, each
receives a penalty of —1 to its roll; if four
are subject, each gets an unmodified saving
throw.

A maximum body weight of 400 pounds
(100 pounds for nonmammals) per animal
per caster level can be affected—e.g., an
8th-level caster can affect up to four 3,200-
pound mammals or a like number of 800-
pound nonmammals, such as birds or
reptiles.

Locate Object (Divination)
Reversible

Sphere: Divination

Range: 60 yards + 10 yd./level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 8 hours

Casting Time: 1 turn

Area of Effect: 1 object

Saving Throw: None

This spell helps locate a known or famil-
iar object. The priest casts the spell, slowly
turns, and will sense when he is facing in the
direction of the object to be located, provid-
ed the object is within range—e.g., 90 yards
for 3rd-level priests, 100 yards for 4th, 110
yards for Sth, etc. The spell locates such
objects as apparel, jewelry, furniture, tools,
weapons, or even a ladder or stairway.
Once the caster has fixed in his mind the
item sought, the spell locates only that item.
Attempting to find a specific item, such as a
kingdom s crown, requires an accurate men-
tal image. If the image is not close enough to
the actual item, the spell does not work; in
short, desired but unique objects cannot be
located by this spell unless they are known
by the caster. The spell is blocked by lead.

The casting requires the use of a piece of
lodestone.

The reversal, obscure object, hides an
object from location by spell, crystal ball,
or similar means for eight hours. The caster
must touch the object being concealed.

Neither application of the spell affects liv-
ing creatures.

Magical Vestment (Enchantment)

Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 5 rounds/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell enchants the caster  s vestment,
providing protection at least the equivalent
of chain mail (AC 5). The vestment gains a
+1 enchantment for each three levels of the
priest beyond Sth level, to a maximum of

211

 

AC 1 at 17th level. The magic lasts for five
rounds per level of the caster, or until the
caster loses consciousness. If the vestment is
worn with other armors, only the best AC
(either the armor or the vestment) is used—
this protection is not cumulative with any
other AC protection.

The material components are the vest-
ment to be enchanted and the priest  s holy
symbol, which are not expended.

Meld Into Stone (Alteration)

Sphere: Elemental (Earth)

Range: 0

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 8 rounds + 1d8 rounds
Casting Time: 6

Area of Effect: Caster

Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the priest to meld his
body and possessions into a single block of
stone. The stone must be large enough to
accommodate his body in all three dimen-
sions. When casting is complete, the priest
and not more than 100 pounds of nonliving
gear merge with the stone. If either condi-
tion is violated, the spell fails and is wasted.

While in the stone, the priest remains in
contact, however tenuous, with the face of
the stone through which he melded. The
priest remains aware of the passage of time.
Nothing that goes on outside the stone can
be seen or heard, however. Minor physical
damage to the stone does not harm the
priest, but its partial destruction, if enough
so that the caster no longer fits, expels the
priest with 4d8 points of damage. The
stone s destruction expels the priest and
slays him instantly, unless a successful sav-
ing throw vs. spell is rolled.

The magic lasts for 1d8+8 rounds, the
variable part of the duration rolled secretly
by the DM. At any time before the duration
expires, the priest can step out of the stone
through the stone surface he entered. If the
duration runs out, or the effect is dispelled
before the priest exits the stone, then he is
violently expelled and suffers 4d8 points of
damage.

The following spells harm the priest if
cast upon the stone that he is occupying:
stone to flesh expels the priest and inflicts
4d8 points of damage; stone shape causes
4d4 points of damage, but does not expel the
priest; transmute rock to mud expels and
slays him instantly unless he rolls a success-
ful saving throw vs. spell; passwall expels
the priest without damage.
Priest Spells (3rd Level)

 

Negative Plane Protection
(Abjuration)

Sphere: Protection, Necromantic
Range: Touch

Components: V, S

Duration: Special

Casting Time: 1 round

Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell affords the caster or touched
creature partial protection from undead
monsters with Negative Material plane con-
nections (such as shadows, wights, wraiths,

, or vampires) and certain weapons
and spells that drain energy levels. The neg-
ative plane protection spell opens a channel
to the Positive Material plane, possibly off-
setting the effect of the negative energy
attack. A protected creature struck by a
negative energy attack is allowed a saving
throw vs. death magic. If successful, the
energies cancel with a bright flash of light
and a thunderclap. The protected creature
suffers only normal hit point damage from
the attack and does not suffer any drain of
experience or Strength, regardless of the
number of levels the attack would have
drained. An attacking undead creature suf-
fers 2d6 points of damage from the Positive
plane energy; a draining wizard or weapon
receives no damage.

This protection is proof against only one
such attack, dissipating immediately wheth-
er or not the saving throw was successful. If
the saving throw is failed, the spell recipient
suffers double the usual physical damage, in
addition to the loss of experience or
Strength that normally occurs. The protec-
tion lasts for one turn per level of the priest
casting the spell, or until the protected crea-
ture is struck by a negative energy attack.
This spell cannot be cast on the Negative
Material plane.

Plant Growth (Alteration)

Sphere: Plant
Range: 160 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

The plant growth spell enables the caster
to choose either of two different uses. The
first causes normal vegetation to grow,
entwine, and entangle to form a thicket or
jungle that creatures must hack or force a
way through at a movement rate of 10 feet
per round (or 20 feet per round for larger-
than-man-sized creatures). Note that the
area must have brush and trees in it in order
for this spell to take effect. Briars, bushes,
creepers, lianas, roots, saplings, thistles,

 

thorn, trees, vines, and weeds become so
thick and overgrown in the area of effect as
to form a barrier. The area of effect is a
square 20 feet on a side per level of experi-
ence of the caster, in any square or rectangu-
lar shape that the caster decides upon at the
time of the spellcasting. Thus an 8th-level
caster can affect a maximum area of 160  
X 160   square, a 320  x 80   rectangle, a
640   X 40   rectangle, a 1,280   X 20   rec-
tangle, etc. The spell  s effects persist in the
area until it is cleared by labor, fire, or such
magical means as a dispel magic spell.

The second use of the spell affects a one-
mile square area. The DM secretly makes a
saving throw (based on the caster  s level) to
see if the spell takes effect. If successful, the
spell renders plants more vigorous, fruitful,
and hardy, increasing yields by 20% to 50%
([1d4+1] * 10  % ), given a normal growing
season. The spell does not prevent disaster
in the form of floods, drought, fire, or
insects, although even in these cases the
plants survive better than expected. This
effect lasts only for the life cycle of one sea-
son, the winter “death” marking the end of a
life cycle even for the sturdiest of trees. In
many farming communities, this spell is
normally cast at planting time as part of the
spring festivals.

Prayer (Conjuration/Summoning)

Sphere: Combat

Range: 0

Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 6

Area of Effect: 60-foot radius
Saving Throw: None

By means of the prayer spell, the priest
brings special favor upon himself and his
party and causes harm to his enemies.
Those in the area at the instant the spell is
completed are affected for the duration of
the spell. When the spell is completed, all
attack and damage rolls and saving throws
made by those in the area of effect who are
friendly to the priest gain +1 bonuses,
while those of the priest  s enemies suffer —1
penalties. Once the prayer spell is uttered,
the priest can do other things, unlike a
chant, which he must continue to make the
spell effective. If another priest of the same
religious persuasion (not merely the same
alignment) is chanting when a prayer is cast,
the effects combine to +2 and —2, as long
as both are in effect at once.

The priest needs a silver holy symbol,
prayer beads, or a similar device as the
material component of this spell.

212

 

Protection From Fire (Abjuration)

Sphere: Protection, Elemental (Fire)
Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M

Duration: Special

Casting Time: 6

Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

The effect of a protection from fire spell
differs according to the recipient of the
magic—either the caster or some other crea-
ture. In either case, the spell lasts no longer
than one turn per caster level.

* If the spell is cast upon the caster, it confers
complete invulnerability to normal fires
(torches, bonfires, oil fires, and the like) and
to exposure to magical fires such as fiery
dragon breath, spells such as burning
hands, fireball, fire seeds, fire storm, flame
strike, meteor swarm, hell hound or pyro-
hydra breath, etc., until the spell has
absorbed 12 points of heat or fire damage
per level of the caster, at which time the spell
is negated.

* If the spell is cast upon another creature, it
gives invulnerability to normal fire, gives a
bonus of +4 to saving throw die rolls vs.
fire attacks, and it reduces damage sus-
tained from magical fires by 50%.

The caster  s holy symbol is the material
component.

Pyrotechnics (Alteration)

Sphere: Elemental (Fire)
Range: 160 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 10 or 100 times
a single fire source
Saving Throw: Special

A pyrotechnics spell draws on an existing
fire source to produce either of two effects,
at the option of the caster.

* First, it can produce a flashing and fiery
burst of glowing, colored aerial fireworks
that lasts one round. This effect temporarily
blinds those creatures in, under, or within
120 feet of the area that also have an unob-
structed line of sight to the effect, for 1d4 +1
rounds unless the creatures roll successful
saving throws vs. spell. The fireworks fill a
volume ten times greater than the original
fire source.

* Second, it can cause a thick, writhing
stream of smoke to arise from the source
and form a choking cloud that lasts for one
round per experience level of the caster. This
covers a roughly hemispherical volume
from the ground or floor up (or conforming
to the shape of a confined area) that totally
obscures vision beyond two feet. The smoke
aCe) oe RD

 

fills a volume 100 times that of the fire
source.

The spell uses one fire source within the
area of effect, which is immediately extin-
guished. An extremely large fire can be used
as the source, and it is only partially extin-
guished by the casting. Magical fires are not
extinguished, although a fire-based creature
(such as a fire elemental) used as a source
suffers 1d4 points of damage, plus 1 point of
damage per caster level. This spell does not
function under water.

Remove Curse (Abjuration)
Reversible

Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 6

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

Upon casting this spell, the priest is usu-
ally able to remove a curse on an object, on
a person, or in the form of some undesired
sending or evil presence. Note that the re-
move curse spell does not remove the curse
from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of ar-
mor, for example, although the spell typi-
cally enables the person afflicted with any
such cursed item to get rid of it. Certain spe-
cial curses may not be countered by this
spell, or may be countered only by a caster
of a certain level or more. A caster of 12th
level or more can cure lycanthropy with this
spell by casting it on the animal form. The
were-creature receives a saving throw vs.
spell and, if successful, the spell fails and the
priest must gain a level before attempting
the remedy on this creature again.

The reverse of the spell is not permanent;
the bestow curse spell lasts for one turn for
every experience level of the priest using the
spell. The curse can have one of the follow-
ing effects (roll percentile dice): 50% of the
time it reduces one ability of the victim to 3
(the DM randomly determines which abil-
ity); 25% of the time it lowers the victim s
attack and saving throw rolls by —4; 25%
of the time it makes the victim 50% likely to
drop whatever he is holding (or do nothing,
in the case of creatures not using tools)—
roll each round.

It is possible for a priest to devise his own
curse, and it should be similar in power to
those given here. Consult your DM. The
subject of a bestow curse spell must be
touched. If the victim is touched, a saving
throw is still applicable; if it is successful,
the effect is negated. The bestowed curse
cannot be dispelled.

 

Remove Paralysis (Abjuration)

Sphere: Protection

Range: 10 yards/level

Components: V, S

Duration: Permanent

Casting Time: 6

Area of Effect: 1d4 creatures in a 20   cube
Saving Throw: None

By the use of this spell, the priest can free
one or more creatures from the effects of
any paralyzation or from related magic
(such as a ghoul touch, or a hold or slow
spell). If the spell is cast on one creature, the
paralyzation is negated. If cast on two crea-
tures, each receives another saving throw
vs. the effect that afflicts it, with a +4 bo-
nus. If cast on three or four creatures, each
receives another saving throw with a +2
bonus. There must be no physical or magi-
cal barrier between the caster and the crea-
tures to be affected, or the spell fails and is
wasted.

Snare (Enchantment/Charm)

Sphere: Plant

Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M

Duration: Permanent until triggered

Casting Time: 3 rounds

Area of Effect: 2  diameter circle plus  /e   per
level of the spellcaster

Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the caster to make a
snare that is 90% undetectable without
magical aid. The snare can be made from
any supple vine, a thong, or a rope. When
the snare spell is cast upon it, the cord-
like object blends with its surroundings.
One end of the snare is tied in a loop that
contracts around one or more of the limbs
of any creature stepping inside the circle
(note that the head of a worm or snake
could be thus ensnared).

If a strong and supple tree is nearby, the
snare can be fastened to it. The magic of the
spell causes the tree to bend and then
straighten when the loop is triggered, inflict-
ing 1d6 points of damage to the creature
trapped, and lifting it off the ground by the
trapped member(s) (or strangling it if the
head/neck triggered the snare). If no such
sapling or tree is available, the cord-like ob-
ject tightens upon the member(s), then
wraps around the entire creature, causing
no damage, but tightly binding it. Under
water, the cord coils back upon its anchor
point. The snare is magical, so for one hour
it is breakable only by cloud giant or greater
Strength (23); each hour thereafter, the
snare material loses magic so as to become 1
point more breakable per hour—22 after
two hours, 21 after three, 20 after four—
until six full hours have elapsed. At that
time, 18 Strength will break the bonds. Af-

213

 

 

ter 12 hours have elapsed, the materials of
the snare lose all magical properties and the
loop opens, freeing anything it held. The
snare can be cut with any magical weapon,
or with any edged weapon wielded with at
least a +2 attack bonus (from Strength, for
example).

The caster must have a snake skin and a
piece of sinew from a strong animal to
weave into the cord-like object from which
he will make the snare. Only the caster s
holy symbol is otherwise needed.

V2. A
 
 

Speak With Dead (Necromancy)

Sphere: Divination
Range: 1

Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

Upon casting a speak with dead spell, the
priest is able to ask several questions of a
dead creature in a set period of time and
receive answers according to the knowledge
of that creature. Of course, the priest must
be able to converse in the language that the
dead creature once used. The length of time
the creature has been dead is a factor, since
only higher level priests can converse with a
long-dead creature. The number of ques-
tions that can be answered and the length of
time in which the questions can be asked

 

Priest Spells (3rd Level)

depend on the level of experience of the
priest. Even if the casting is successful, such
creatures are as evasive as possible when
questioned. The dead tend to give extremely
brief and limited answers, often cryptic, and
to take questions literally. Furthermore,
their knowledge is often limited to what
they knew in life.

A dead creature of different alignment or
of higher level or Hit Dice than the caster  s
level receives a saving throw vs. spell. A
dead creature that successfully saves can
refuse to answer questions, ending the spell.
At the DM s option, the casting of this spell
on a given creature might be restricted to
once per week.

The priest needs a holy symbol and burn-
ing incense in order to cast this spell upon
the body, remains, or a portion thereof. The
remains are not expended. This spell does
not function under water.

Spike Growth (Alteration, Enchantment)

Sphere: Plant

Range: 60 yards

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 3d4 turns + 1/level
Casting Time: 6

Area of Effect: 10-foot square/level
Saving Throw: None

Wherever any type of plant growth of
moderate size or density is found, this spell
can be used. The ground-covering vegeta-
tion or roots and rootlets in the area
becomes very hard and sharply pointed. In
effect the ground cover, while appearing to
be unchanged, acts as if the area were
strewn with caltrops. In areas of bare
ground or earthen pits, roots and rootlets
act in the same way. For each 10 feet of
movement through the area, the victim suf-
fers 2d4 points of damage. He must also roll
a saving throw vs. spell. If this saving throw
is failed, the victim  s movement rate is
reduced by  /3 from its current total (but a
creature s movement rate can never be less
than 1). This penalty lasts for 24 hours, after
which the character s normal movement
rate is regained.

Without the use of a spell such as true see-
ing, similar magical aids, or some other spe-
cial means of detection (such as detect traps
or detect snares and pits), an area affected
by spike growth is absolutely undetectable

 

as such until a victim enters the area and suf-
fers damage. Even then, the creature cannot
determine the extent of the perilous area
unless some means of magical detection is
used.

The components for this spell are the
priest s holy symbol and either seven sharp
thorns or seven small twigs, each sharpened
to a point.

Starshine (Evocation, Illusion/Phantasm)

Sphere: Sun

Range: 10 yd/level

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 1 turn/level

Casting Time: 6

Area of Effect: 10-foot square/level
Saving Throw: None

A starshine spell enables the caster to
softly illuminate an area as if it were
exposed to a clear night sky filled with stars.
Regardless of the height of the open area in
which the spell is cast, the area immediately
beneath it is lit by starshine. Vision ranges
are the same as those for a bright moonlit
night—movement noted out to 100 yards;
stationary creatures seen up to 50 yards;
general identifications made at 30 yards;
recognition at 10 yards. The spell creates
shadows and has no effect on infravision.
The area of effect actually appears to be a
night sky, but disbelief of the illusion merely

214

 

   

enables the disbeliever to note that the
“stars” are actually evoked lights. This spell
does not function under water.

The material components are several
stalks from an amaryllis plant (especially
Hypoxis) and several holly berries.

Stone Shape (Alteration)

Sphere: Elemental (Earth)

Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M

Duration: Permanent

Casting Time: 1 round

Area of Effect: 3   cube plus 1   cube/level
Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the caster can form
an existing piece of stone into any shape that
suits his purposes. For example, a stone
weapon can be made, a special trapdoor
fashioned, or a crude idol sculpted. By the
same token, it enables the spellcaster to
reshape a stone door, perhaps so as to
escape imprisonment, providing the volume
of stone involved was within the limits of
the area of effect. While stone coffers can be
thus formed, stone doors made, etc., the
fineness of detail is not great. If the shaping
has moving parts, there is a 30% chance
they do not work.

The material component of this spell is
soft clay that must be worked into roughly
the desired shape of the stone object, and
then touched to the stone when the spell is
uttered.

Summon Insects
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Sphere: Animal

Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The summon insects spell attracts a cloud
or swarm of normal insects to attack the
foes of the caster. Flying insects appear 70%
of the time, while crawling insects appear
30% of the time. The exact insects called are
bees, biting flies, hornets, or wasps, if flying
insects are indicated; biting ants or pinching
beetles, if crawling insects are indicated. A
cloud of the flying type, or a swarm of the
crawling sort, appears after the spell is cast.
This gathers at a point chosen by the caster,
within the spell  s range, and attacks any sin-
gle creature the caster points to.

The attacked creature sustains 2 points of
damage if it does nothing but attempt to flee
or fend off the insects during the time it is
attacked; it suffers 4 points of damage per
round otherwise. If the insects are ignored,
the victim fights with a —2 penalty to his
attack roll and a +2 penalty to his Armor
Priest Spells (4th Level)

 

Class. If he attempts to cast a spell, an initia-
tive roll should be made for the insects to see
if their damage occurs before the spell is
cast. If it does, the victim  s concentration is
ruined and the spell is lost.

The insects disperse and the spell ends if
the victim enters thick smoke or hot flames.
Besides being driven off by smoke or hot
flames, the swarm might possibly be out-
run, or evaded by plunging into a sufficient
body of water. If evaded, the summoned
insects can be sent against another oppo-
nent, but there will be at least a 1 round
delay while they leave the former opponent
and attack the new victim. Crawling insects
can travel only about 10 feet per round
(maximum speed over smooth ground) and
flying insects travel 60 feet per round. The
caster must concentrate to maintain the
swarm; it dissipates if he moves or is dis-
turbed.

It is possible, in underground situations,
that the caster might summon 1d4 giant ants
by means of the spell, but the possibility is
only 30% unless giant ants are nearby. This
spell does not function under water.

The materials needed for this spell are the
caster  s holy symbol, a flower petal, and a
bit of mud or wet clay.

Tree (Alteration)

Sphere: Plant

Range: 0

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 6 turns + 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 6

Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the caster is able to
assume the form of a small living tree or
shrub or that of a large dead tree trunk with
but a few limbs. Although the closest
inspection cannot reveal that this plant is
actually a person, and for all normal tests he
is, in fact, a tree or shrub, the caster is able
to observe all that goes on around him just
as if he were in normal form. The Armor
Class and hit points of the plant are those of
the caster. The caster can remove the spell at
any time, instantly changing from plant to
his normal form and having full capability
for any action normally possible (including
spellcasting). Note that all clothing and gear
worn or carried change with the caster.

The material components of this spell are
the priest s holy symbol and a twig from a
tree.

 

Water Breathing (Alteration)
Reversible

Sphere: Elemental (Water, Air)
Range: Touch

Components: V, S

Duration: 1 hour/level

Casting Time: 6

Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

The recipient of a water breathing spell is
able to breathe under water freely for the
duration of the spell—i.e., one hour for
each experience level of the caster. The
priest can divide the base duration between
multiple characters. Thus an 8th-level priest
can confer this ability to two characters for
four hours, four for two hours, eight for one
hour, etc., to a minimum of 1/2 hour per
character.

The reverse, air breathing, enables water-
breathing creatures to survive comfortably
in the atmosphere for an equal duration.
Note that neither version prevents the recip-
ient creature from breathing in its natural
element.

Water Walk (Alteration)

Sphere: Elemental (Water)
Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn + 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 6

Area of Effect: Special

Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the caster is able to
empower one or more creatures to tread
upon any liquid as if it were firm ground;
this includes mud, quicksand, oil, running
water, and snow. The recipient s feet do not
touch the surface of the liquid, but oval
depressions of his appropriate foot size and
two inches deep are left in the mud or snow.
The recipient s rate of movement remains
normal. If cast underwater, the recipient is
borne toward the surface.

For every level of the caster above the
minimum required to cast the spell (Sth
level), he can affect another creature.

The material components for this spell are
a piece of cork and the priest s holy symbol.

 

 

 

Fourth-Level Spells

Abjure (Abjuration)

Sphere: Summoning
Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

This spell can send an extraplanar crea-
ture back to its own plane of existence. The
spell fails against entities of demigod status
or greater, but their servants or minions can
be abjured. If the creature has a specific
(proper) name, then that must be known
and used. Any magic resistance of the sub-
ject must be overcome, or the spell fails. The
priest has a 50% chance of success (a roll of
11 or better on 1d20). The roll is adjusted by
the difference in level or Hit Dice between
the caster and the creature being abjured:
the number needed is decreased if the priest
has more Hit Dice and increased if the crea-
ture has more Hit Dice. If the spell is suc-
cessful, the creature is instantly hurled back
to its own plane. The affected creature must
survive a system shock check. If the crea-
ture does not have a Constitution score, the
required roll is 70% + 2% /Hit Die or level.
The caster has no control over where in the
creature s plane the abjured creature
arrives. If the attempt fails, the priest must
gain another level before another attempt
can be made on that particular creature.

The spell requires the priest s holy sym-
bol, holy water, and some material inimical
to the creature.

Animal Summoning I
(Conjuration, Summoning)

Sphere: Animal, Summoning
Range: 1 mile radius
Components: V, S

Duration: Special

Casting Time: 7

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the caster calls up
to eight animals that have 4 Hit Dice or less,
of whatever sort the caster names when the
summoning is made. Only animals within
range of the caster at the time the spell is cast
will come. The caster can try three times to
summon three different types of animals—
€.g., suppose that wild dogs are first sum-
moned to no avail, then hawks are
unsuccessfully called, and finally the caster
calls for wild horses that may or may not be
within summoning range. Your DM must
determine the chance of a summoned ani-
mal type being within the range of the spell.
The animals summoned aid the caster by
whatever means they possess, staying until
a fight is over, a specific mission is finished,
the caster is safe, he sends them away, etc.
Only normal or giant animals can be sum-
moned; fantastic animals or monsters can-
not be summoned by this spell (no
chimerae, dragons, gorgons, manticores,
etc.).

Call Woodland Beings
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Sphere: Summoning
Range: 100 yards/level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Neg.

By means of this spell, the caster is able to
summon certain woodland creatures to his
location. Naturally, this spell works only
outdoors, but not necessarily only in wood-
ed areas. The caster begins the incantation
and continues uninterrupted until some
called creature appears or two turns have
elapsed. (The verbalization and somatic
gesturing are easy, so this is not particularly
exhausting to the spellcaster.) Only one type

diam) ie cc RD)

 

of the following sorts of beings can be sum-
moned by the spell. They come only if they
are within the range of the call.

The caster can call three times, for a dif-
ferent type each time. Once a call is success-
ful, no other type can be called without
another casting of the spell. (Your DM will
consult his outdoor map or base the proba-
bility of any such creature being within spell
range upon the nature of the area the caster
is in at the time of spellcasting.)

The creature(s) called by the spell are
entitled to a saving throw vs. spell (with a
—4 penalty) to avoid the summons. Any
woodland beings answering the call are
favorably disposed to the spellcaster and
give whatever aid they are capable of. How-
ever, if the caller or members of the caller s
party are of evil alignment, the creatures are
entitled to another saving throw vs. spell
(this time with a +4 bonus) when they come
within 10 yards of the caster or another evil
character with him. These beings immedi-
ately seek to escape if their saving throws
are successful. In any event, if the caster
requests that the summoned creatures
engage in combat on his behalf, they are
required to roll a loyalty reaction check
based on the caster  s Charisma and what-
ever dealings he has had with them.

This spell works with respect to neutral or
good woodland creatures, as determined by
the DM. Thus the DM can freely add to or
alter the list as he sees fit.

If the caster personally knows a certain
individual woodland being, that being can
be summoned at double the normal range. If
this is done, then no other woodland crea-
tures are affected.

The material components of this spell are
a pine cone and eight holly berries.

If a percentage chance is given, druids
and other nature-based priests add 1% per
caster level. These chances can be used if no
other campaign information on the area is
available.

Cloak of Bravery
(Conjuration/Summoning)
Reversible

Sphere: Charm

Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M

Duration: Special

Casting Time: 6

Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Neg.

The cloak of bravery spell can be cast
upon any willing creature. The protected
individual gains a bonus to his saving throw
against any form of fear encountered (but
not awe—an ability of some Lesser and
Greater Powers). When cast, the spell can
affect one to four creatures (caster  s choice).
If only one is affected, the saving throw
bonus is +4. If two are affected, the bonus
is +3, and so forth, until four creatures are
protected by a +1 bonus. The magic of the
cloak of bravery spell works only once and
then the spell ends, whether or not the crea-
ture  s saving throw is successful. The spell
ends after eight hours if no saving throw is
required before then.

The reverse of this spell, cloak of fear,
empowers a single creature touched to radi-
ate a personal aura of fear, at will, out toa
three-foot radius. All other characters and
creatures within this aura must roll success-
ful saving throws vs. spell or run away in
panic for 2d8 rounds. Affected individuals
may or may not drop items, at the DM s
option.

The spell has no effect upon undead of
any sort. The effect can be used but once,
and the spell expires after eight hours if not
brought down earlier. Members of the recip-
ient s party are not immune to the effects of
the spell.

The material component for the cloak of
bravery spell is the feather of an eagle or
hawk. The reverse requires the tail feathers
of a vulture or chicken.

Control Temperature, 10  Radius
(Alteration)

Sphere: Weather

Range: 0

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 4 turns + 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 7

Area of Effect: 10-foot radius
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the temperature
surrounding the caster can be altered by 10
degrees Fahrenheit, either upward or down-
ward, per level of experience of the spell-
caster. Thus, a 10th-level caster could raise
or lower the surrounding temperature from
1 to 100 degrees. The spell can be used to
ensure the comfort of the caster and those
with him in extreme weather conditions.
 

The party could stand about in shirt sleeves
during the worst blizzard (although it would
be raining on them) or make ice for their
drinks during a scorching heat wave.

The spell also provides protection from
intense normal and magical attacks. If the
extreme of temperature is beyond what
could be affected by the spell (a searing blast
of a fireball or the icy chill of a white
dragon), the spell reduces the damage
caused by 5 points for every level of the
caster. Normal saving throws are still
allowed, and the reduction is taken after the
saving throw is made or failed. Once struck
by such an attack, the spell immediately col-
lapses.

The material component for this spell is a
strip of willow bark (to lower temperatures)
or raspberry leaves (to raise temperatures).

Cure Serious Wounds (Necromancy)
Reversible

Sphere: Healing

Range: Touch

Components: V, S

Duration: Permanent

Casting Time: 7

Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell is a more potent version of the
cure light wounds spell. When laying his
hand upon a creature, the priest heals
2d8+1 points of wound or other injury
damage to the creature s body. This healing
cannot affect noncorporeal, nonliving, or
extraplanar creatures.

Cause serious wounds, the reverse of the
spell, operates similarly to the cause light
wounds spell, the victim having to be touch-
ed first. If the touch is successful, 2d8+1
points of damage are inflicted.

Detect Lie (Divination)
Reversible

Sphere: Divination
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 7

Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

A priest who casts this spell is immedi-
ately able to determine if the subject crea-
ture deliberately and knowingly speaks a
lie. It does not reveal the truth, uncover
unintentional inaccuracies, or necessarily
reveal evasions. The subject receives a sav-
ing throw vs. spell, which is adjusted only
by the Wisdom of the caster—e.g., if the
caster has a Wisdom of 18, the subject s sav-
ing throw roll is reduced by 4 (see Table 5).

The material component for the detect lie
spell is one gp worth of gold dust.

 

gti any Tote od AD)

The spell  s reverse, undetectable lie, pre-
vents the magical detection of lies spoken by
the creature for 24 hours.

The reverse requires brass dust as its
material component.

Divination (Divination)

Sphere: Divination
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

A divination spell is used to garner a use-
ful piece of advice concerning a specific
goal, event, or activity that will occur with-
in a one-week period. This can be as simple
as a short phrase, or it might take the form
of a cryptic rhyme or omen. Unlike the
augury spell, this gives a specific piece of
advice. For example, if the question is “Will
we do well if we venture to the third level?”
and a terrible troll guarding 10,000 gp and a
shield +1 lurks near the entrance to the
level (the DM estimates the party could beat
the troll after a hard fight) the divination
response might be: “Ready oil and open
flame light your way to wealth.” In all cases,
the DM controls what information is
received and whether additional divinations
will supply additional information. Note
that if the information is not acted upon, the
conditions probably change so that the
information is no longer useful (in the exam-
ple, the troll might move away and take the
treasure with it).

The base chance for a correct divination
is 60%, plus 1% for each experience level of
the priest casting the spell. The DM makes
adjustments to this base chance considering
the actions being divined (if, for example,
unusual precautions against the spell have
been taken). If the dice roll is failed, the cast-
er knows the spell failed, unless specific
magic yielding false information is at work.

The material components of the divina-
tion spell are a sacrificial offering, incense,
and the holy symbol of the priest. If an
unusually important divination is attempt-
ed, sacrifice of particularly valuable gems,
jewelry, or magical items may be required.

Free Action (Abjuration, Enchantment)

Sphere: Charm

Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 1 turn/level

Casting Time: 7

Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the creature touched to
move and attack normally for the duration
of the spell, even under the influence of

217

 

magic that impedes movement (such as web
or slow spells) or while under water. It even
negates or prevents the effects of paralysis
and hold spells, Under water, the individual
moves at normal (surface) speed and inflicts
full damage, even with such cutting weap-
ons as axes and swords and with such
smashing weapons as flails, hammers, and
maces, provided that the weapon is wielded
in the hand rather than hurled. The free
action spell does not, however, allow water
breathing without further appropriate mag-
ic.

The material component is a leather
thong, bound around the arm or similar
appendage, which disintegrates when the
spell expires.

Giant Insect (Alteration)
Reversible

Sphere: Animal

Range: 20 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special

Casting Time: 7

Area of Effect: 1 to 6 insects
Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the priest can turn
one or more normal-sized insects into larger
forms resembling the giant insects described
in the Monstrous Compendium. Only one
type of insect can be altered at one time (i.e.,
a single casting cannot affect both an ant
and a fly) and all insects affected must be
grown to the same size. The number of
insects and the size to which they can be
grown depend upon the priest s level:

Priest s Insect Maximum

Level Hit Dice Total HD
7-9 3 9
10-12 4 12
13+ 6 15

For example, an 8th-level priest can grow
three insects to 3 Hit Dice, four insects to 2
Hit Dice, or nine insects to 1 hit die. Flying
insects of 3 Hit Dice or more can carry a
rider of human size (assume that such can
carry 80 pounds per Hit Die).

If the casting is interrupted for any rea-
son, or if the insects are currently subject to
any other magical effect (including this
one), the insects die and the spell is ruined.
The DM decides how many normal insects
of what type are available; this is often a
greater limitation on the spell than the limits
above.

If the insect created by this spell matches
an existing monster description, use the
monster description. Otherwise, unless the
DM creates a special description, the giant
form has an Armor Class of between 8 and
4, one attack, and inflicts 1d4 points of
damage per Hit Die.
  

Example: A 14th-level priest uses the gi-
ant insect spell to enlarge one beetle (all that
is available) to 6 HD size. The DM decides
the beetle has AC 5 and bites once for 6d4
points of damage.

Note that the spell works only on actual
insects. Arachnids, crustaceans, and other
types of small creatures are not affected.
Any giant insects created by this spell do not
attempt to harm the priest, but the priest s
control of such creatures is limited to simple
commands (“attack,” “defend,” “guard,” and
so forth). Orders to attack a certain creature
when it appears or guard against a particu-
lar occurrence are too complex. Unless com-
manded to do otherwise, the giant insects
attempt to attack whoever or whatever is
near them.

The reverse of the spell, shrink insect, re-
duces any giant insect to normal insect size.
The number of Hit Dice affected by the
priest is subtracted from the number of Hit
Dice of the insects, and any insect reduced
to 0 Hit Dice has been shrunk. Partial
shrinking is ignored; an insect is either
shrunk or unaffected. Thus, a 9th-level
priest attacked by giant ants could shrink
three warrior ants or four worker ants to
normal insect size with no saving throw.
This spell has no effect on intelligent insect-
like creatures.

The priest must use his holy symbol for
either version of the spell.

Hallucinatory Forest
(Illusion/Phantasm)
Reversible

Sphere: Plant

Range: 80 yards

Components: V, S

Duration: Permanent

Casting Time: 7

Area of Effect: 40-foot square/level
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, a hallucinatory
forest comes into existence. The illusionary
forest appears to be perfectly natural and is
indistinguishable from a real forest. Priests
attuned to the woodlands—as well as such
creatures as centaurs, dryads, green drag-
ons, nymphs, satyrs, and treants—
recognize the forest for what it is. All other
creatures believe it is there, and movement
and order of march are affected accordingly.
Touching the illusory growth neither affects
the magic nor reveals its nature. The hallu-
cinatory forest remains until it is magically
dispelled by a reverse of the spell or a dispel
magic spell, The area shape is either roughly
rectangular or square, in general, and at
least 40 feet deep, in whatever location the
caster desires. The forest can be of less than
maximum area if the caster wishes. One of
its edges can appear up to 80 yards away
from the caster.

Hold Plant (Enchantment/Charm)

Sphere: Plant

Range: 80 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 7

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Neg.

The hold plant spell affects vegetable
matter as follows: 1) it causes ambulatory
vegetation to cease moving; 2) it prevents
vegetable matter from entwining, grasping,
closing, or growing; 3) it prevents vegetable
matter from making any sound or move-
ment that is not caused by wind. The spell
effects apply to all forms of vegetation, in-
cluding parasitic and fungoid types, and
those magically animated or otherwise mag-
ically empowered. It affects such monsters
as green slime, molds of any sort, shambling
mounds, shriekers, treants, etc. The dura-
tion of a hold plant spell is one round per
level of experience of the caster, It affects
1d4 plants in a 40   X 40   area—or a square
four to 16 yards on a side of small ground
growth such as grass or mold. If but one
plant (or four yards square) is chosen as the
target for the spell by the caster, the saving
throw of the plant (or area of plant growth)
is made with a ~4 penalty to the die roll; if
two plants (or eight yards square) are the
target, saving throws suffer a —2 penalty; if
three plants (or 12 yards square) are the tar-
get, saving throws suffer a —1 penalty; and
if the maximum of four plants (or 16 yards
square) are the target, saving throws are un-
modified.

Imbue With Spell Ability
(Enchantment)

Sphere: Charm

Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special

Casting Time: 1 turn

Area of Effect: Person touched
Saving Throw: None

By the use of this spell, the priest can
transfer a limited number and selection of
his currently memorized spells, and the abil-
ity to cast them, to another person. Only
non-spellcasters (including rangers under
8th level and paladins under 9th level) can
receive this bestowal; the imbue with spell
ability enchantment does not function for
those belonging to spellcasting classes, for
unintelligent monsters, nor for any individ-
ual with less than 1 full Hit Die. In addition,
the person thus imbued must have a Wis-
dom score of 9 or higher. Only priest spells
of an informational or defensive nature or a
cure light wounds spell can be transferred.
Transferring any other spell type negates the

218

 

   

entire attempt, including any allowable
spells that were chosen, Higher level per-
sons can receive more than one spell at the
priest s option:

Level of Recipient Spells Imbued
1 One 1st-level spell
3 Two 1st-level spells
5+ Two Ist- and one
2nd-level spells

The transferred spell  s variable character-
istics (range, duration, area of effect, etc.)
function according to the level of the priest
originally imbuing the spell.

A priest who casts imbue with spell abil-
ity upon another character loses the number
of 1st- and 2nd-level spells he has imbued
until the recipient uses the transferred spells
or is slain. For example, a 7th-level priest
with five Ist- and four 2nd-level spells im-
bues a 10th-level fighter with a cure light
wounds spell and a slow poison spell. The
cleric now can have only four Ist-level
spells memorized until the cure is cast and
only three 2nd-level spells until the slow
poison is cast, or until the fighter is killed. In
the meantime, the priest remains responsi-
ble to his ethos for the use to which the spell
is put.

The material components for this spell are
the priest s holy symbol, plus some minor
item from the recipient that is symbolic of
his profession (a lockpick for a thief, etc.).
This item, and any material component for
the imbued spell, is consumed when the im-
bue with spell ability spell is cast.

Lower Water (Alteration)
Reversible

Sphere: Elemental (Water)
Range: 120 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

The lower water spell causes water or
similar fluid in the area of effect to sink
away to a minimum depth of one inch. The
depth can be lowered by up to two feet for
every experience level of the priest. The wa-
ter is lowered within a square area whose
sides are 10 feet long per caster level. Thus,
an 8th-level priest affects a volume up to 16  
* 80   X 80  , a 9th-level caster affects a vol-
ume up to 18   X 90   X 90  , and so on. In
extremely large and deep bodies of water,
such as deep ocean, the spell creates a whirl-
pool that sweeps ships and similar craft
downward, putting them at risk and render-
ing them unable to leave by normal move-
ment for the duration of the spell. When
cast on water elementals and other water-
based creatures, this spell acts as a slow
Priest Spells (4th Level)

 

spell: the creature moves at half speed and
makes half its usual number of attacks each
round. The spell has no effect on other crea-
tures.

Its reverse, raise water, causes water or
similar fluids to return to their highest natu-
ral level: spring flood, high tide, etc. This
can make fords impassable, float grounded
ships, and may even sweep away bridges at
the DM s option. It negates lower water and
vice versa.

The material components of this spell are
the priest s holy (or unholy) symbol and a
pinch of dust.

Neutralize Poison (Necromancy)
Reversible

Sphere: Healing

Range: Touch

Components: V, S

Duration: Permanent

Casting Time: 7

Area of Effect: Creature touched or 1 cubic
foot of substance/2 levels

Saving Throw: None

By means of a neutralize poison spell, the
priest detoxifies any sort of venom in the
creature or substance touched. Note that an
opponent, such as a poisonous reptile or
snake (or even an envenomed weapon of an
opponent) unwilling to be so touched
requires the priest to roll a successful attack
in combat. This spell can prevent death in a
poisoned creature if cast before death
occurs. The effects of the spell are perma-
nent only with respect to poison existing in
the touched creature at the time of the
touch, thus creatures (and objects) that gen-
erate new poison are not permanently
detoxified.

The reversed spell, poison, likewise
requires an attack roll that succeeds, and the
victim is allowed a saving throw vs. poison.
If the latter is unsuccessful, the victim is
incapacitated and dies in one turn unless the
poison is magically neutralized or slowed.

Plant Door (Alteration)

Sphere: Plant

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 7

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

The plant door spell opens a magical portal
or passageway through trees, undergrowth,
thickets, or any similar growth—even
growth of a magical nature. The plant door
is open to the caster who cast the spell, cast-
ers of a higher level, or dryads; others must
be shown the location of the door. The door
even enables the caster to enter a solid tree

 

trunk and remain hidden there until the
spell ends. The spell also enables the passage
or hiding of any man-sized or smaller crea-
ture; hiding is subject to space consider-
ations. If the tree is cut down or burned,
those within must leave before the tree falls
or is consumed, or else they are killed also.
The duration of the spell is one turn per level
of experience of the caster. If the caster opts
to stay within an oak, the spell lasts nine
times longer, if in an ash tree, it lasts three
times longer than normal. The path created
by the spell is up to four feet wide, eight feet
high, and 12 feet long per level of experience
of the caster. This spell does not function on
plant-based monsters—e.g., shambling
mounds, molds, slimes, treants, etc.

The material components for this spell are
a piece of charcoal and the caster  s holy

symbol.

Produce Fire (Alteration)
Reversible

Sphere: Elemental (Fire)
Range: 40 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round

Casting Time: 7

Area of Effect: 12-foot square
Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the caster causes a
common fire of up to 12 feet per side in area.
Though it lasts but a single round, unless it
ignites additional flammable material, the
fire produced by the spell inflicts 1d4 points
of damage plus 1 point per caster level (1d4
+ 1/level) upon creatures within its area. It
ignites combustible materials, such as cloth,
oil, paper, parchment, wood, and the like,
so as to cause continued burning.

The reverse, quench fire, extinguishes
any normal fire (coals, oil, tallow, wax,
wood, etc.) within the area of effect.

The material component for either ver-
sion is a paste of sulfur and wax, formed
into a ball and thrown at the target.

Protection From Evil, 10  Radius
(Abjuration)
Reversible

Sphere: Protection

Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 1 turn/level

Casting Time: 7

Area of Effect: 10-foot-radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

The globe of protection of this spell is
identical in all respects to that of a protec-
tion from evil spell, except that it encom-
passes a much larger area and its duration is
greater. The effect is centered on and moves
with the creature touched. Any protected

219

 

creature within the circle will break the
warding against enchanted/summoned
monsters if he attacks those monsters. A
creature unable to fit completely into the
area of effect (for example, a 21-foot-tall
titan) remains partially exposed and subject
to whatever penalties the DM decides. If
such a creature is the recipient of the spell,
the spell acts as a normal protection from
evil spell for that creature only.

The reverse, protection from good, 10 
radius, wards against good creatures.

To complete this spell, the priest must
trace a circle 20 feet in diameter using holy
(or unholy) water and incense (or smolder-
ing dung), according to the protection from
evil spell.

Protection From Lightning
(Abjuration)

Sphere: Protection, Weather
Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M

Duration: Special

Casting Time: 7

Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

The effect of a protection from lightning
spell changes depending on who is the recip-
ient of the magic—the caster or some other
creature. In either case, the spell lasts no
longer than one turn per caster level.

* If the spell is cast upon the caster, it
confers complete invulnerability to electri-
cal attack such as dragon breath, or magical
lightning such as lightning bolt, shocking
grasp, storm giant, will ‘o wisp, etc., until
the spell has absorbed 10 points of electrical
damage per level of the caster, at which time
the spell is negated.

* If the spell is cast upon another crea-
ture, it gives a bonus of +4 to the die roll for
saving throws made vs. electrical attacks,
and it reduces the damage sustained from
such attacks by 50%.

The caster  s holy symbol is the material
component.

Reflecting Pool (Divination)

Sphere: Divination
Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 2 hours
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the caster to cause a
pool of normal water found in a natural set-
ting to act as a scrying device. The pool can
be of no greater diameter than two feet per
level of the caster. The effect is to create a
scrying device similar to a crystal ball. The
  

scrying can extend only to those planes of
existence that are coexistent with or border
on the Prime Material plane—the inner
planes (including the para-elemental planes,
plane of Shadow, etc.). General notes on
scrying, detection by the subject, and penal-
ties for attempting to scry beyond the cast-
er  s own plane are given in the DMG, as well
as a description of the crystal ball item.

The following spells can be cast through a
reflecting pool, with a 5% per level chance
for operating correctly: detect magic, detect
snares and pits, detect poison. Each addi-
tional detection attempt requires a round of
concentration, regardless of success. Infra-
vision, if available, operates normally
through the reflecting pool.

The image is nearly always hazy enough
to prevent the reading of script of any type.

The material component is the oil extract-
ed from such nuts as the hickory and the
walnut, refined, and dropped in three mea-
sures upon the surface of the pool. (A mea-
sure need be no more than a single ounce of
oil.)

At the DM s option, the casting of this
spell may be limited to once per day.

Repel Insects (Abjuration, Alteration)

Sphere: Animal, Protection
Range: 0

Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 1 round

Area of Effect: 10-foot radius
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the priest creates
an invisible barrier to all sorts of insects,
and normal insects do not approach within
10 feet of the caster while the spell is in
effect. Giant insects with Hit Dice less than
1/3 of the caster  s experience level are also
repelled (e.g., 2 Hit Dice for 7th- to 9th-level
casters, 3 Hit Dice at 10th through 12th
level, etc.). Insects with more Hit Dice can
enter the protected area if the insect is espe-
cially aggressive and, in addition, rolls a
successful saving throw vs. spell. Those that
do sustain 1d6 points of damage from pass-
ing of the magical barrier. Note that the
spell does not in any way affect arachnids,
myriapods, and similar creatures—it affects
only true insects.

The material components of the repel
insects spell include any one of the follow-
ing: several crushed marigold flowers, a
whole crushed leek, seven crushed stinging
nettle leaves, or a small lump of resin from a
camphor tree.

Priest Spells (4th Level)

 

Speak With Plants (Alteration)

Sphere: Plant

Range: 0

Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1 turn

Area of Effect: 30-foot radius
Saving Throw: None

When cast, a speak with plants spell
enables the priest to converse, in very rudi-
mentary terms, with all sorts of living vege-
tables (including fungi, molds, and
plant-like monsters, such as shambling
mounds) and to exercise limited control
over normal plants (i.e., not monsters or
plant-like creatures), Thus, the caster can
question plants as to whether or not crea-
tures have passed through them, cause
thickets to part to enable easy passage,
require vines to entangle pursuers, and com-
mand similar services. The spell does not
enable plants to uproot themselves and
move about, but any movements within the
plants   normal capabilities are possible.
Creatures entangled by the 1st-level spell of
that name can be released. The power of the
spell lasts for one round for each experience
level of the casting priest. All vegetation
within the area of effect is affected by the
spell.

The material components for this spell are
a drop of water, a pinch of dung, and a
flame.

Spell Immunity (Abjuration)

Sphere: Protection

Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 1 turn/level

Casting Time: 1 round

Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the priest renders a
creature touched immune to the effects of a
specified spell of 4th level or lower. It pro-
tects against spells, spell-like effects of magi-
cal items, and innate spell-like abilities of
creatures. It does not protect against breath
weapons or gaze attacks of any type. The
spell has additional limitations, First, the
caster must have directly experienced the
effect of the spell specified. For example, if
the caster has been attacked by a fireball
spell at some time, then he can use spell
immunity to provide protection from a fire-
ball. Second, the spell cannot affect a crea-
ture already magically protected by a
potion, protective spell, ring, or other
device. Third, only a particular spell can be
protected against, not a certain sphere of
spells or a group of spells that are similar in
effect; thus, a creature given immunity to
the lightning bolt spell is still vulnerable to a
shocking grasp spell.

The material component for spell immu-
nity is the same as that for the spell to be
protected against.

Sticks to Snakes (Alteration)
Reversible

Sphere: Plant

Range: 30 yards

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 2 rounds/level

Casting Time: 7

Area of Effect: 1d4 sticks + 1 stick/levelina
10-foot cube

Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the caster can
change 1d4 sticks, plus one stick per experi-
ence level, into snakes; thus a 9th-level
priest can change 10-13 sticks into an equal
number of snakes. These snakes attack as
commanded by the priest. There must, of
course, be sticks or similar pieces of wood
(such as torches, spears, etc.) to turn into
snakes. Such a stick cannot be larger than a
staff. Sticks held by creatures are allowed a
saving throw equal to that of the possessor
(i.e., a spear held by an orc must fail the
orc  s saving throw vs. polymorph). Magical
items, such as staves and enchanted spears,
are not affected by the spell. Only sticks
within the area of effect are changed. The
type of snake created varies, but a typical
specimen has 2 Hit Dice, Armor Class 6, a
movement rate of 9, and either constricts
for 1d4+1 points of damage per round or
bites for 1 point plus poison (if any). The
chance of a snake thus changed being ven-
omous is 5% per caster level, if the spellcast-
er desires. Thus, an 11th-level priest has a
maximum 55% chance that any snake cre-
ated by the spell is poisonous. The spell lasts
for two rounds for each experience level of
the spellcaster.

The material components of the spell are a
small piece of bark and several snake scales.

The reverse changes normal-sized snakes
to sticks for the same duration, or it negates
the sticks to snakes spell according to the
level of the priest countering the spell (e.g.,
a 10th-level priest casting the reverse spell
can turn 11-14 snakes back into sticks).

Tongues (Alteration)
Reversible

Sphere: Divination
Range: 0

Components: V, S
Duration: 1 turn

Casting Time: 7

Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the caster to speak and
understand additional languages, whether
they are racial tongues or regional dialects,
but not communications of animals or
mindless creatures. When the spell is cast,
the spellcaster selects the language or lan-
guages to be understood. The spell then em-
powers the caster with the ability to speak
and understand the language desired with
perfect fluency and accent. The spell enables
the priest to be understood by all speakers
of that language within hearing distance,
usually 60 feet. This spell does not predis-
pose the subject toward the caster in any
way. The priest can speak one additional
tongue for every three levels of experience.

The reverse of the spell cancels the effect
of the tongues spell or confuses verbal com-
munication of any sort within the area of ef-
fect.

 

Fifth-Level Spells

Air Walk (Alteration)

Sphere: Elemental (Air)

Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 1 hour + 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 8

Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables a creature, which can
be as large as the largest giant, to tread upon
air just as if it were solid ground. Moving
upward is similar to walking up a hill; a
maximum upward angle of 45 degrees is
possible at one-half the creature s move-
ment rate. Likewise, a maximum downward

 

angle of 45 degrees at the normal movement
rate is possible. An air-walking creature is
always in control of its movement rate, save
when a wind is blowing. In this case the
creature gains or loses 10 feet of movement
for every 10 miles per hour of wind velocity.
The creature may, at the DM s option, be
subject to additional penalties, loss of con-
trol, and possible damage in exceptionally
strong or turbulent winds.

The spell can be placed upon a trained
mount, so it can be ridden through the air.
Of course, a mount not accustomed to such
movement would certainly need careful and
lengthy training, the details of which are up
to the DM.

The material components for the spell are
the priest s holy symbol and a bit of thistle-
down.

Animal Growth (Alteration)
Reversible

Sphere: Animal

Range: 80 yards

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 2 rounds/level

Casting Time: 8

Area of Effect: Up to 8 animals in a
20-foot-square area

Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the caster causes
all animals, up to a maximum of eight,
within a 20-foot-square area to grow to
twice their normal size. The effects of this
growth are doubled Hit Dice (with resultant
improvement in attack potential), doubled
hit points (except hit points added to Hit
Dice), and doubled damage in combat.
Movement and AC are not affected. The
spell lasts for two rounds for each level of
the caster. The spell is particularly useful in
conjunction with a charm person or mam-
mal spell.

The reverse reduces animal size by one-
half, and likewise reduces Hit Dice, hit
points, attack damage, etc.

The material component for this spell and
its reverse is the caster  s holy symbol and a
scrap of food.

Animal Summoning Il
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Sphere: Animal, Summoning
Range: 60 yards/level
Components: V, S

Duration: Special

Casting Time: 8

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the caster calls up
to six animals that have 8 Hit Dice or less, or
12 animals of 4 Hit Dice or less, of whatever
sort the caster names. Only animals within

221

Priest Spells (5th Level)

 

  

range of the caster at the time the spell is cast
will come. The caster can try three times to
summon three different types of animals—
suppose that wild dogs are first summoned
to no avail, then hawks are unsuccessfully
called, and finally the caster calls for wild
horses that may or may not be within sum-
moning range. Your DM will determine the
chance of a summoned animal type being
within range of the spell. The animals sum-
moned aid the caster by whatever means
they possess, staying until a fight is over, a
specific mission is finished, the caster is safe,
he sends them away, etc. Only normal or gi-
ant animals can be summoned; fantastic an-
imals or monsters cannot be summoned by
this spell (no chimerae, dragons, gorgons,
manticores, etc.).

Anti-Piant Shell (Abjuration)

Sphere: Plant, Protection

Range: 0

Components: V, S

Duration: 1 turn/level

Casting Time: 8

Area of Effect: 15   diameter hemisphere
Saving Throw: None

The anti-plant shell spell creates an invisi-
ble, mobile barrier that keeps out all crea-
tures or missiles of living vegetable
material. Thus, the caster (and any crea-
tures within the shell) is protected from at-
tacking plants or vegetable creatures such as
shambling mounds or treants. Any attempt
to force the barrier against such creatures
shatters the barrier immediately. The spell
lasts for one turn for each experience level of
the caster.

Atonement (Abjuration)

Sphere: All

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: 1 person
Saving Throw: None

This spell is used by the priest to remove
the burden of unwilling or unknown deeds
from the person who is the subject of the
atonement. The spell removes the effects of
magical alignment change as well. The per-
son seeking the atonement spell must either
be truly repentant or not have been in com-
mand of his own will when the acts to be
atoned for were committed. Your DM will
judge this spell in this regard, noting any
past instances of its use upon the person.
Deliberate misdeeds and acts of knowing
and willful nature cannot be atoned for with
this spell (see the quest spell). A character
who refuses to accept an atonement is auto-
matically considered to have committed a
willful misdeed.

  
  

The priest needs his religious symbol,
prayer beads or wheel or book, and burning
incense.

Commune (Divination)
Sphere: Divination

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

By use of a commune spell, the priest is
able to contact his divinity—or agents
thereof—and request information in the
form of questions that can be answered by a
simple “yes” or “no.” The priest is allowed
one such question for every experience level
he has attained. The answers given are cor-
rect within the limits of the entity  s knowl-
edge (“I don  t know” is a legitimate answer,
as powerful outer planar beings are not nec-
essarily omniscient). Optionally, the DM
may give a single short answer, of five
words or less. The spell will, at best, pro-
vide information to aid character decisions.
Entities communed with structure their an-
swers to further their own purposes. It is
probable that the DM will limit the use of
commune spells to one per adventure, one
per week, or even one per month, for the
greater powers dislike frequent interrup-
tions. Likewise, if the caster lags, discusses
the answers, or goes off to do anything else,
the spell immediately ends.

The material components necessary to a
commune spell are the priest s religious sym-
bol, holy (unholy) water, and incense. If a
particularly potent commune is needed, a
sacrifice proportionate with the difficulty of
obtaining the information is required, and if
the offering is insufficient, only partial or no
information is gained.

Commune With Nature (Divination)

Sphere: Divination
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the caster to become
one with nature in the area, thus being em-
powered with knowledge of the surround-
ing territory. For each level of experience of
the caster, he can “know” one fact: the
ground ahead, left or right; the plants
ahead, left or right; the minerals ahead, left
or right; the water courses/bodies of water
ahead, left or right; the people dwelling
ahead, left or right; the general animal pop-
ulation, left or right; the presence of wood-
land creatures, left or right; etc. The

Priest Spells (5th Level)

 

presence of powerful unnatural creatures
can also be detected, as can the general state
of the natural setting. The spell is most ef-
fective in outdoor settings, operating in a
radius of one-half mile for each level of the
caster. In natural underground settings—
caves, caverns, etc.—the range is limited to
10 yards per caster level. In constructed set-
tings (dungeons and towns), the spell will
not function. The DM may limit the casting
of this spell to once per month.

Control Winds (Alteration)

Sphere: Weather

Range: 0

Components: V, S

Duration: 1 turn/level

Casting Time: 8

Area of Effect: 40-foot/level radius
Saving Throw: None

By means of a control winds spell, the
caster is able to alter wind force in the area
of effect. For every three levels of experi-
ence, the caster can increase or decrease
wind force by one level of strength. Wind
strengths are as follows:

Wind Force Miles Per Hour
Light Breeze 2-7
Moderate Breeze 8-18
Strong Breeze 19-31
Gale 32-54
Storm 55-72
Hurricane 73-176

Winds in excess of 19 miles per hour drive
small flying creatures (those eagle-sized and
under) from the skies, severely affect missile
accuracy, and make sailing difficult. Winds
in excess of 32 miles per hour drive even
man-sized flying creatures from the skies
and cause minor ship damage. Winds in ex-
cess of 55 miles per hour drive all flying
creatures from the skies, uproot trees of
small size, knock down wooden structures,
tear off roofs, etc., and endanger ships.
Winds in excess of 73 miles per hour are of
hurricane force.

An “eye” of 40-foot radius, in which the
wind is calm, exists around the caster. Note
that while the spell can be used in under-
ground places, the eye shrinks one foot for
every foot of confinement, if the spell is cast
in an area smaller than the area of effect.
(For example, if the area of effect is a 360-
foot radius, and the space only allows a 350-
foot area, the eye shrinks by 10 feet to a
30-foot radius; a space under 320 feet in ra-
dius would eliminate the eye and subject the
spellcaster to the effects of the wind.)

Once the spell is cast, the wind force in-
creases (or decreases) by 3 miles per hour
per round until the maximum (or minimum)
speed is attained. The caster, with one
round of complete concentration, can stabi-
lize the wind at its current strength, or set it

222

 

   

to increase or decrease, although the rate of
the change cannot be altered. The spell re-
mains in force for one turn for each level of
experience of the caster. When the spell is
exhausted, the force of the wind wanes (or
waxes) at the same rate, until it reaches the
level it was at before the spell took effect.
Another caster can use a control winds spell
to counter the effects of a like spell up to the
limits of his own ability.

Cure Critical Wounds (Necromancy)
Reversible

Sphere: Healing

Range: Touch

Components: V, S

Duration: Permanent

Casting Time: 8

Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

The cure critical wounds spell is a very
potent version of the cure light wounds
spell. The priest lays his hand upon a crea-
ture and heals 3d8+3 points of damage
from wounds or other damage. The spell
does not affect creatures without corporeal
bodies, those of extraplanar origin, or those
not living.

The reversed spell, cause critical wounds,
operates in the same fashion as other cause
wounds spells, requiring a successful touch
to inflict the 3d8+3 points of damage.
Caused wounds heal via the same methods
as do wounds of other sorts.

Dispel Evil (Abjuration)
Reversible

Sphere: Protection, Summoning
Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 1 round/level

Casting Time: 8

Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Neg.

The priest using this spell causes a sum-
moned creature of evil nature, an evil crea-
ture from another plane, or a creature
summoned by an evil caster, to return to its
own plane or place when the caster success-
fully strikes it in melee combat. (Examples
of such creatures are aerial servants, djinn,
efreet, elementals, and invisible stalkers.)
An evil enchantment (such as a charm spell
cast by an evil creature) that is subject to a
normal dispel magic spell can be automati-
cally dispelled by the dispel evil spell. Note
that this spell lasts for a maximum of one
round for each experience level of the caster,
or until expended. While the spell is in ef-
fect, all creatures that could be affected by it
attack with a —7 penalty to their attack
rolls when erigaging the spellcaster.
The reverse of the spell, dispel good,
functions against summoned or enchanted
creatures of good alignment or creatures
that have been sent to aid the cause of good.

The material components for this spell are
the priest s religious object and holy (or un-
holy) water.

Flame Strike (Evocation)

Sphere: Combat
Range: 60 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: S-foot radius
by 30-foot-high column
Saving Throw: 1/2

When the priest calls down a flame strike
spell, a vertical column of fire roars down-
ward in the exact location called for by the
caster. Any creature within the area of effect
of a flame strike must roll a saving throw vs.
spell. Failure means the creature sustains
6d8 points of damage; otherwise, the dam-
age is halved.

The material component of this spell is a
pinch of sulphur.

Insect Plague (Conjuration/Summoning)

Sphere: Combat

Range: 120 yards

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 2 rounds/level

Casting Time: 1 turn

Area of Effect: 180   diameter, 60   high cloud
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast by the priest, a
horde of creeping, hopping, and flying in-
sects gather and swarm in a thick cloud, (In
an environment free of normal insects, the
spell fails.) The insects obscure vision, limit-
ing it to 10 feet. Spellcasting within the
cloud is impossible. Creatures in the insect
plague sustain 1 point of damage for each
round they remain within, due to the bites
and stings of the insects, regardless of Ar-
mor Class. Invisibility is no protection. All
creatures with 2 or fewer Hit Dice will auto-
matically move at their fastest possible
speed in a random direction until they are
more than 240 yards away from the insects.
Creatures with fewer than 5 Hit Dice must
check morale; failure means they run as de-
scribed above.

Heavy smoke drives off insects within its
bounds. Fire also drives insects away; a wall
of fire in a ring shape keeps a subsequently
cast insect plague outside its confines, but a
fireball simply clears insects from its blast
area for one round. A single torch is ineffec-
tive against this vast horde of insects. Light-
ning, cold, or ice are likewise ineffective,
while a strong wind that covers the entire
plague area disperses the insects and ends

 

the spell. The plague lasts two rounds for
each level of the caster, and thereafter the
insects disperse.

The insects swarm in an area that centers
around a summoning point determined by
the spellcaster; the point can be up to 120
yards away from the priest. The insect
plague does not move thereafter for as long
as it lasts. Note that the spell can be coun-
tered by a dispel magic spell.

The material components of this spell are
a few grains of sugar, some kernels of grain,
and a smear of fat.

Magic Font (Divination)

Sphere: Divination
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration; Special
Casting Time: 1 hour
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

The spell causes a holy water font to serve
as a scrying device. The spell does not func-
tion unless the priest is in good standing
with his deity. The basin of holy water be-
comes similar to a crystal ball. For each vial
of capacity of the basin, the priest may scry
for one round, up to a maximum of one
hour; thus, the duration of the magic font
spell is directly related to the size of the holy
water receptacle. The DM will know the
chances of a character being able to detect

scrying.
The priest s holy symbol and the font and
its trappings are not consumed by the spell.

Moonbeam (Evocation, Alteration)

Sphere: Sun

Range: 60 yards + 10 yards/level

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 1 round/level

Casting Time: 7

Saving Throw: None

Area of Effect: 5-foot-radius sphere
(plus special)

Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the caster is able to
cause a beam of soft, pale light to strike
downward from overhead and illuminate
whatever area he is pointing at. The light is
exactly the same as moonlight, so that col-
ors other than shades of black, gray, or
white are vague. The spellcaster can easily
make the moonbeam move to any area that
he can see and point to. This makes the spell
an effective way to spotlight something, an
opponent, for example. While the moon-
beam spell does not eliminate all shadows, a
creature centered in a moonbeam is most
certainly visible. The reflected light from
this spell enables dim visual perception 10
yards beyond the area of effect, but it does
not shed a telltale glow that would negate

223

Priest Spells (5th Level)

 

  

surprise. The light does not adversely affect
infravision. The caster can dim the beam to
near darkness if desired. The beam has, in
addition, all the properties of true moon-
light and can induce a lycanthropic change
(while in the beam), unless your DM rules
otherwise.

The material components are several
seeds of any moonseed plant and a piece of
opalescent feldspar (moonstone).

Pass Plant (Alteration)

Sphere: Plant

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 8

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

By using this spell, the caster is able to en-
ter a tree and move from inside it to inside
another tree of the same type that lies in ap-
proximately the direction desired by the
spell user and is within the range shown in
the following table.

Type of Tree Range of Area of Effect

Oak 600 yards
Ash 540 yards
Yew 480 yards
Elm 420 yards
Linden 360 yards
deciduous 300 yards
coniferous 240 yards
other 180 yards

The tree entered and that receiving the
caster must be of the same type, must both
be living, and of girth at least equal to that
of the caster. Note that if the caster enters a
tree, an ash, for example, and wishes to pass
north as far as possible (540 yards), but the
only appropriate ash in range is to the
south, the caster will pass to the ash in the
south. The pass plant spell functions so that
the movement takes only one round. The
caster can, at his option, remain within the
receiving tree for a maximum of one round
per level of experience. Otherwise, he can
step forth immediately. Should no like tree
be in range, the caster simply remains
within the tree, does not pass elsewhere,
and must step forth in the appropriate num-
ber of rounds. If the occupied tree is
chopped down or burned, the caster is slain
if he does not exit before the process is com-
plete.

 

  
  

Plane Shift (Alteration)

Sphere: Astral

Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M

Duration: Permanent

Casting Time: 8

Area of Effect: Creature touched (special)
Saving Throw: Neg.

When the plane shift spell is cast, the
priest moves himself or some other creature
to another plane of existence. The recipient
of the spell remains in the new plane until
sent forth by some like means. If several
persons link hands in a circle, up to eight
can be affected by the plane shift at the same
time.

The material component of this spell is a
small, forked metal rod—the exact size and
metal type dictating to which plane of exist-
ence (including sub-planes and alternate
dimensions) the spell sends the affected
creatures. (Your DM will determine specifics
regarding how and what planes are
reached.)

An unwilling victim must be touched
(successful attack roll) in order to be sent; in
addition, the creature is also allowed a sav-
ing throw. If the saving throw is successful,
the effect of the spell is negated. Note that
pinpoint accuracy is rarely achieved; arriv-
ing a random distance from an intended des-
tination is common.

The metal rod is not expended when the
spell is cast. Forked rods keyed to certain
planes may be difficult to come by, as decid-
ed by the DM.

Quest (Enchantment/Charm)

Sphere: Charm

Range: 60 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Until fulfilled
Casting Time: 8

Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

The quest spell enables the priest to
require the affected creature to perform a
service and return to the priest with proof
that the deed was accomplished. The quest
can, for example, require that the creature
locate and return some important or valu-
able object, rescue a notable person, release
some creature, capture a stronghold, slay a
person, deliver some item, and so forth. If
the quest is not properly followed, due to
disregard, delay, or perversion, the creature
affected by the spell loses 1 from its saving
throw rolls for each day of such action. This
penalty is not removed until the quest is
properly pursued or the priest cancels it.
(There are certain circumstances that will
temporarily suspend a quest, and others
that will discharge or cancel it; your DM
will give you appropriate information as the

Priest Spells (5th Level)

 

need to know arises.)

If cast upon an unwilling subject, the vic-
tim is allowed a saving throw. However if
the person quested agrees to a task, even if
the agreement is gained by force or trickery,
no saving throw is allowed. If a quest is just
and deserved, a creature of the priest s reli-
gion cannot avoid it, and any creature of the
priest s alignment saves with a —4 penalty
to the saving throw, in any case. A quest
cannot be dispelled but can be removed by a
priest of the same religion or of higher level
than the caster. Some artifacts and relics
might negate the spell, as can direct inter-
vention by a deity. Likewise, an unjust or
undeserved quest grants bonuses to its sav-
ing throws, or might even automatically
fail!

The material component of this spell is
the priest s holy symbol.

Rainbow (Evocation, Alteration)

Sphere: Weather, Sun
Range: 120 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 7

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

In order to cast this spell, the priest must
be in sight of a rainbow of any sort, or have
a special component (see below). The rain-
bow spell has two applications, and the
priest can choose the desired one at the time
of casting. These applications are as fol-
lows:

Bow: The spell creates a shimmering,
multi-layered short composite bow of rain-
bow hues. It is light and easy to pull, so that
any character can use it without penalty for
non-proficiency. It is magical: Each of its
shimmering missiles is the equivalent of a
+2 weapon, including attack and damage
bonuses. Magic resistance can negate the
effect of any missile fired from the bow. The
bow fires seven missiles before disappear-
ing. It can be fired up to four times per
round. Each time a missile is fired, one hue
leaves the bow, corresponding to the color
of arrow that is released. Each color of
arrow has the ability to cause double dam-
age to certain creatures, as follows:
Red—fire dwellers/users and fire elementals
Orange—creatures or constructs of clay,

sand, earth, stone or similar mate-
rials, and earth elementals
Yellow—vegetable opponents (including
fungus creatures, shambling
mounds, treants, etc.)
Green—aquatic creatures and water ele-
mentals
Blue—aerial creatures, electricity-using
creatures, and air elementals.
Indigo—acid-using or poison-using crea-
tures

224 (

 

 

Violet—metallic or regenerating creatures

When the bow is drawn, an arrow of the
appropriate color magically appears,
nocked and ready. If no color is requested,
or a color that has already been used is
asked for, then the next arrow (in the order
of the spectrum) appears.

Bridge: The caster causes the rainbow to
form a seven-hued bridge up to three feet
wide per level of the caster. It must be at
least 20 feet long and can be as long as 120
yards, according to the caster  s desire. It
lasts as long as the spell duration or until
ordered out of existence by the caster.

The components for this spell are the
priest s holy symbol and a vial of holy
water. If no rainbow is in the vicinity, the
caster can substitute a diamond of not less
than 1,000 gp value, specially prepared with
bless and prayer spells while in sight of a
rainbow. The holy water and diamond dis-
appear when the spell is cast.

Raise Dead (Necromancy)
Reversible

Sphere: Necromantic
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 person
Saving Throw: Special

When the priest casts a raise dead spell, he
can restore life to a dwarf, gnome, half-elf,
halfling, or human (other creatures may be
allowed, at the DM s option). The length of
time that the person has been dead is of
importance, as the priest can raise persons
dead only up to a limit of one day for each
experience level of the priest (i.e., a 9th-
level priest can raise a person who has been
dead for up to nine days).

Note that the body of the person must be
whole, or otherwise missing parts are still
missing when the person is brought back to
life. Likewise, other ills, such as poison and
disease, are not negated. The raised person
must roll a successful resurrection survival
check to survive the ordeal (see Table 3:
Constitution) and loses 1 point of Constitu-
tion. Furthermore, the raised person is weak-
and helpless in any event, and he needs a
minimum of one full day of rest in bed for
each day or fraction he was dead. The per-
son has but 1 hit point when raised and must
regain the rest by natural healing or curative
magic.

Note that a character s starting Constitu-
tion is an absolute limit to the number of
times the character can be revived by this
means.

The somatic component of the spell is a
pointed finger.

The reverse of the spell, slay living,
Priest Spells (5th Level)

 

grants the victim a saving throw vs. death
magic, and if it is successful, the victim sus-
tains damage equal only to that of a cause
serious wounds spell—i.e., 2d8+1 points.
Failure means the victim dies instantly.

Spike Stones (Alteration, Enchantment)

Sphere: Elemental (Earth)

Range: 30 yards

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 3d4 turns + 1/level

Casting Time: 6

Area of Effect: 10-foot square per level, 1
spike per 1-foot sq.

Saving Throw: None

The spike stones spell causes rock to
shape itself into long, sharp points that tend
to blend into the background. It is effective
on both natural rock and worked stone. The
spike stones serve to impede progress
through an area and to inflict damage. If an
area is carefully observed, each observer is
25% likely to notice the sharp points of
rock. Otherwise, those entering the spell  s
area of effect suffer 1d4 points of damage
per round. The success of each attack is
determined as if the caster of the spell were
actually engaging in combat. Those enter-
ing the area are subject to attack immedi-
ately upon setting foot in the area and for
each round spent in the area thereafter. The
initial step enables the individual to become
aware of some problem only if the initial
attack succeeds; otherwise movement con-
tinues and the spike stones remain unno-
ticed until damage occurs. Charging or
running victims suffer two attacks per
round,

Those falling into pits affected by spike
stones suffer six such attacks for every 10
feet fallen, each attack having a +2 bonus
to the attack roll. In addition, the damage
inflicted by each attack increases by +2 for
every 10 feet fallen. Finally, the creatures
also suffer any normal falling damage.

The material component of this spell is
four tiny stalactites.

Transmute Rock to Mud (Alteration)
Reversible

Sphere: Elemental (Earth, Water)
Range: 160 yards

Components: V, S, M

Duration: Special

Casting Time: 8

Area of Effect: 20-foot cube/level
Saving Throw: None

This spell turns natural rock of any sort
into an equal volume of mud. If it is cast
upon a rock, for example, the rock affected
collapses into mud. Magical or enchanted
stone is not affected by the spell. The depth
of the mud created cannot exceed 10 feet.

 

Creatures unable to levitate, fly, or other-
wise free themselves from the mud sink at
the rate of +/s of their height per round and
eventually suffocate, save for lightweight
creatures that could normally pass across
such ground. Brush thrown atop the mud
can support creatures able to climb on top
of it, with the amount required decided by
the DM. Creatures large enough to walk on
the bottom can move through the area at a
rate of 10 feet per round.

The mud remains until a successful dispel
magic or transmute mud to rock spell
restores its substance—but not necessarily
its form. Evaporation turns the mud to nor-
mal dirt at a rate of 1d6 days per 10 cubic
feet. The exact time depends on exposure to
the sun, wind, and normal drainage.

The reverse, transmute mud to rock,
hardens normal mud or quicksand into soft
stone (sandstone or similar mineral) perma-
nently unless magically changed. Creatures
in the mud are allowed a saving throw to
escape before the area is hardened to stone.
Dry sand is unaffected.

The material components for the spell are
clay and water (or sand, lime, and water for
the reverse).

True Seeing (Divination)
Reversible

Sphere: Divination

Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 8

Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

When the priest employs this spell, he
confers upon the recipient the ability to see
all things as they actually are. The spell pen-
etrates normal and magical darkness. Secret
doors become plain. The exact location of
displaced things is obvious. Invisible things
become quite visible. Illusions and appari-
tions are seen through. Polymorphed,
changed, or enchanted things are apparent.
Even the aura projected by creatures
becomes visible, so that alignment can be
discerned. Furthermore, the recipient can
focus his vision to see into the Ethereal plane
or the bordering areas of adjacent planes.
The range of vision co. is 120 feet.
True seeing, however, does not penetrate
solid objects; it in no way confers X-ray
vision or its equivalent. Furthermore, the
spell effects cannot be further enhanced
with known magic.

The spell requires an ointment for the
eyes that is made from very rare mushroom
powder, saffron, and fat and costs no less
than 300 gp per use.

The reverse, false seeing, causes the per-
son to see things as they are not: rich is poor,
rough is smooth, beautiful is ugly. The oint-

225

 

ment for the reverse spell is concocted of oil,
poppy dust, and pink orchid essence.

For both spells, the ointment must be
aged for 1d6 months.

Wall of Fire (Conjuration/Summoning)

Sphere: Elemental (Fire)
Range: 80 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 8

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

The wall of fire spell brings forth an
immobile, blazing curtain of magical fire of
shimmering color—yellow-green or amber
(different from the 4th-level wizard ver-
sion). The spell creates an opaque sheet of
flame up to one 20-foot square per level of
the spellcaster, or a ring with a radius of up
to 10 feet + five feet for every two levels of
experience of the wizard, and 20 feet high.

The wall of fire must be cast so that it is
vertical with respect to the caster. One side
of the wall, selected by the caster, sends
forth waves of heat, inflicting 2d4 points of
damage upon creatures within 10 feet and
1d4 points of damage upon those within 20
feet. In addition, the wall inflicts 4d4 points
of damage, plus 1 point of damage per level
of the spellcaster, to any creature passing
through it. Creatures especially subject to
fire may take additional damage, and
undead always take twice normal damage,
Note that attempting to directly catch mov-
ing creatures with a newly created wall of
fire is difficult; a successful saving throw
enables the creature to avoid the wall, while
its rate and direction of movement deter-
mine which side of the created wall it is on.
The wall of fire lasts as long as the priest
concentrates on maintaining it, or one
round per level of experience of the priest in
the event he does not wish to concentrate
upon it.

The material component of the spell is
phosphorus.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
  

Sixth-Level Spells

Aerial Servant
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Sphere: Summoning
Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 day/level
Casting Time: 9

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell summons an invisible aerial ser-
vant to find and bring back an object or
creature described to it by the priest. Unlike
an elemental, an aerial servant cannot be
commanded to fight for the caster. When it
is summoned, the priest must have cast a
protection from evil spell, be within a pro-
tective circle, or have a special item used to
control the aerial servant. Otherwise, it
attempts to slay its summoner and return
from whence it came.

The object or creature to be brought must
be such as to allow the aerial servant to
physically bring it to the priest (an aerial
servant can carry at least 1,000 pounds). If
prevented, for any reason, from completing
the assigned duty, the aerial servant
becomes insane and seeks out and attempts
to destroy the caster. The aerial servant
returns to its own plane whenever the spell
lapses, its duty is fulfilled, it is dispelled, the
priest releases it, or the priest is slain. The
spell lasts for a maximum of one day for
each level of experience of the priest who
cast it.

If the creature to be fetched cannot detect
invisible objects, the aerial servant attacks,
automatically gaining surprise. If the crea-
ture involved can detect invisible objects, it
still suffers a —2 penalty to all surprise rolls
caused by the aerial servant. Each round of
combat, the aerial servant must roll to
attack. When a hit is scored, the aerial ser-
vant has grabbed the item or creature it was
sent for. A creature with a Strength rating is
allowed an evasion roll, equal to twice its
bend bars chance, to escape the hold. If the
creature in question does not have a
Strength rating, roll 1d8 for each Hit Die the
aerial servant and the creature grabbed
have. The higher total is the stronger. Once
seized, the creature cannot free itself by
Strength or Dexterity and is flown to the
priest forthwith.

Priest Spells (6th Level)

 

Animal Summoning Ill
(Conjuration, Summoning)

Sphere: Animal, Summoning
Range: 100 yards/level
Components: V, S

Duration: Special

Casting Time: 9

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell is the same in duration and
effect as the 4th-level animal summoning I
spell, except that up to four animals of no
more than 16 Hit Dice each can be summon-
ed, or eight of no more than 8 Hit Dice, or
16 creatures of no more than 4 Hit Dice.
Only animals within range of the caster at
the time the spell is cast will come. The cast-
er can try three times to summon three dif-
ferent types of animals—e.g., suppose that
wild dogs are first summoned to no avail,
then hawks are unsuccessfully called, and
finally the caster calls for wild horses that
may or may not be within summoning
range. Your DM will determine the chance
of a summoned animal type being within
range of the spell. The animals summoned
will aid the caster by whatever means they
possess, staying until a fight is over, a spe-
cific mission is finished, the caster is safe, he
sends them away, etc. Only normal or giant
animals can be summoned; fantastic ani-
mals or monsters cannot be summoned by
this spell (no chimerae, dragons, gorgons,
manticores, etc.).

Animate Object (Alteration)

Sphere: Creation, Summoning
Range: 30 yards

Components: V, S

Duration: 1 round/level

Casting Time: 9

Area of Effect: 1 cubic foot/level
Saving Throw: None

This powerful spell enables the priest
casting it to imbue inanimate objects with
mobility and a semblance of life. The ani-
mated object, or objects, then attacks
whomever or whatever the priest first desig-
nates. The animated object can be of any
nonmagical material whatsoever—wood,
metal, stone, fabric, leather, ceramic, glass,
etc. Attempting to animate an object in
someone s possession grants that person a
saving throw to prevent the spell  s effect.
The speed of movement of the object
depends on its means of propulsion and its
weight. A large wooden table would be
rather heavy, but its legs would give it
speed. A rug could only slither along. A jar
would roll. Thus a large stone pedestal
would rock forward at 10 feet per round, a
stone statue would move at 40 feet per
round, a wooden statue 80 feet per round,
an ivory stool of light weight would move at

226

 

 

120 feet per round. Slithering movement is
about 10 feet to 20 feet per round; rolling is
30 feet to 60 feet per round. The damage
caused by the attack of an animated object
depends on its form and composition. Light,
supple objects can only obscure vision,
obstruct movement, bind, trip, smother,
etc. Light, hard objects can fall upon or oth-
erwise strike for 1d2 points of damage or
possibly obstruct and trip, as do light, sup-
ple objects. Hard, medium-weight objects
can crush or strike for 2d4 points of dam-
age, while larger and heavier objects may
inflict 3d4, 4d4, or even Sd4 points of dam-

The frequency of attack of animated
objects depends on their method of locomo-
tion, appendages, and method of attack.
This varies from as seldom as once every
five melee rounds to as frequently as once
per round, The Armor Class of the object
animated is basically a function of material
and movement ability. Damage depends on
the type of weapon and the object struck. A
sharp cutting weapon is effective against
fabric, leather, wood, and like substances.
Heavy smashing and crushing weapons are
useful against wood, stone, and metal
objects. Your DM will determine all of these
factors, as well as how much damage the
animated object can sustain before being
destroyed. The priest can animate one cubic
foot of material for each experience level he
has attained. Thus, a 14th-level priest could
animate one or more objects whose solid
volume did not exceed 14 cubic feet—a large
statue, two rugs, three chairs, or a dozen
average crocks.

Anti-Animal Shell (Abjuration)

Sphere: Animal, Protection

Range: 0

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 1 turn/level

Casting Time: 1 round

Area of Effect: 20   diameter hemisphere
Saving Throw: None

By casting this spell, the caster brings into
being a hemispherical force field that pre-
vents the entrance of any sort of living crea-
ture that is wholly or partially animal (not
magical or extraplanar). Thus a sprite, a
giant, or a chimera would be kept out, but
undead or conjured creatures could pass
through the shell of force, as could such
monsters as aerial servants, imps, quasits,
golems, elementals, etc. The anti-animal
shell functions normally against cross-
breeds, such as cambions, and lasts for one
turn for each level of experience the caster
has attained. Forcing the barrier against
creatures strains and ultimately collapses
the field.

The spell requires the caster  s holy symbol
and a handful of pepper.
Priest Spells (6th Level)

 

Blade Barrier (Evocation)

Sphere: Guardian, Creation
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: 3 rounds/level
Casting Time: 9

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

The priest employs this spell to set up a
wall of circling, razor-sharp blades. These
whirl and flash around a central point, cre-
ating an immobile barrier. Any creature
that attempts to pass through the blade bar-
rier suffers 8d8 points of damage in doing
so. The plane of rotation of the blades can
be horizontal, vertical, or in between. Crea-
tures within the area of the barrier when it is
invoked are entitled to a saving throw vs.
spell. If this is successful, the blades are
avoided and no damage is suffered; the
creature escapes the area of the blade barrier
by the shortest possible route. The barrier
remains for three rounds for every experi-
ence level of the priest casting it. The barrier
can cover any area from as small as five feet
square to as large as 60 feet square.

Conjure Animals
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Sphere: Summoning
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 9

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

The conjure animals spell enables the
priest to magically create one or more mam-
mals to attack his opponents. The total Hit
Dice of the mammals cannot exceed twice
his level, if the creature conjured is deter-
mined randomly, or his level, if a specific
animal type is requested. The DM selects
the type of animal that appears if it is ran-
domly called. Thus, a priest of 12th level
could randomly conjure two mammals with
12 Hit Dice each, four with 6 Hit Dice each,
six with 4 Hit Dice each, eight with 3 Hit
Dice each, 12 with 2 Hit Dice each, or 24
with 1 Hit Die each. Count every +1 hit
point added to a creature s Hit Dice as 1/4 of
a Hit Die. Thus a creature with 4+3 Hit
Dice equals a 43/4 Hit Dice creature. The
conjured animals remain for two rounds for
each level of the conjuring priest, or until
slain, and they follow the caster  s verbal
commands. Conjured animals unfailingly
attack the priest s opponents, but resist
being used for any other purpose; they do
not like it, become noticeably more difficult
to control, and may refuse any action,
break free, or turn on the caster, depending
on the nature of the creature and the details

 

of the situation. The conjured animals dis-
appear when slain.

Conjure Fire Elemental
(Conjuration/Summoning)
Reversible

Sphere: Elemental (Fire)
Range: 80 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 6 rounds
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting a conjure fire elemental
spell, the caster opens a special gate to the
elemental plane of Fire, and a fire elemental
is summoned to the vicinity of the spellcast-
er. It is 65% likely that a 12 Hit Dice elemen-
tal appears, 20% likely that a 16 Hit Dice
elemental appears, 9% likely that two to
four salamanders appear, 4% likely that an
efreeti appears, and 2% likely that a huge
fire elemental of 21 to 24 Hit Dice appears.
The conjuring caster need not fear that the
elemental force summoned will turn on him,
so concentration upon the activities of the
fire elemental (or other creatures summon-
ed) or protection from the creature is not
necessary. The elemental summoned helps
the caster however possible, including
attacking opponents of the caster. The fire
elemental or other creature summoned
remains for a maximum of one turn per level
of the caster, or until it is slain, sent back by
a dispel magic spell, the reverse of this spell
(dismiss fire elemental), or similar magic.

Find the Path (Divination)
Reversible

Sphere: Divination

Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 1 turn/level

Casting Time: 3 rounds

Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

The recipient of this spell can find the
shortest, most direct physical route that he
is seeking, be it the way into or out of a
locale. The locale can be outdoors or under
ground, a trap, or even a maze spell. Note
that the spell works with respect to locales,
not objects or creatures within a locale.
Thus, the spell could not find the way to “a
forest where a green dragon lives” or to the
location of “a hoard of platinum pieces.”
The location must be in the same plane as
the caster.

The spell enables the subject to sense the
correct direction that will eventually lead
him to his destination, indicating at the
appropriate times the exact path to follow
(or physical actions to take—for example,

227

 

with concentration the spell enables the sub-
ject to sense trip wires or the proper word to
bypass a glyph). The spell ends when the
destination is reached or when one turn for
each caster level has elapsed. The spell frees
the subject, and those with him, from a
maze spell in a single round, and will con-
tinue to do so as long as the spell lasts.

Note that this divination is keyed to the
caster, not his companions, and that, like
the find traps spell, it does not predict or
allow for the actions of creatures.

The spell requires a set of divination
counters of the sort favored by the priest—
bones, ivory counters, sticks, carved runes,
or whatever.

The reverse spell, lose the path, makes the
creature touched totally lost and unable to
find its way for the duration of the spell,
although it can be led, of course.

Fire Seeds (Conjuration)

Sphere: Elemental (Fire)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special

Casting Time: 1 round/seed
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

The fire seeds spell creates special missiles
or timed incendiaries that burn with great
heat. The spell can be cast to create either
fire seed missiles or fire seed incendiaries, as
chosen when the spell is cast.

* Fire seed missiles: This casting turns up
to four acorns into special grenade-like mis-
siles that can be hurled up to 40 yards. An
attack roll is required to strike the intended
target, and proficiency penalties are consid-
ered. Each acorn bursts upon striking any
hard surface, causing 2d8 points of damage
and igniting any combustible materials
within a 10-foot diameter of the point of
impact. If a successful saving throw vs. spell
is made, a creature within the burst area
receives only one-half damage, but a crea-
ture struck directly suffers full damage (i.e.,
no saving throw).

* Fire seed incendiaries. This casting turns
up to eight holly berries into special incendi-
aries. The holly berries are most often
placed, being too light to make effective
missiles (they can be tossed up to six feet
away). They burst into flame if the caster is
within 40 yards and speaks a word of com-
mand. The berries instantly ignite, causing
1d8 points of damage to any creature and
igniting any combustible within a five-foot-
diameter burst area. Creatures within the
area that successfully save vs. spell suffer
half é

All fire seeds lose their power after a
duration equal to one turn per experience
level of the caster—e.g., the seeds of a 13th-
level caster remain potent for a maximum of
 
 

13 turns after their creation.
No other material components beyond
acorns or holly berries are needed for this

spell.

Forbiddance (Abjuration)
Sphere: Protection

Range: 30 yards

Components: V, S, M

Duration: Permanent

Casting Time: 6 rounds

Area of Effect: One 60-foot cube/level
Saving Throw: Special

This spell can be used to secure a conse-
crated area (see DMG). The spell seals the
area from teleportation, plane shifting, and
ethereal penetration. At the option of the
caster, the ward can be locked by a
password, in which case it can be entered
only by those speaking the proper words.
Otherwise, the effect on those entering the
enchanted area is based on their alignment,
relative to the caster  s. The most severe pen-
alty is used.

Alignment identical: No effect. If
password locked, cannot enter area unless
password is known (no saving throw).

Alignment different with respect to law
and chaos: Save vs. spell to enter the area; if
failed, suffer 2d6 points of damage. If
password locked, cannot enter unless
password is known.

Alignment different with respect to good
and evil: Save vs. spell to enter this area; if
failed, suffer 4d6 points of damage. If word
locked, cannot enter unless password is
known. The attempt does cause damage if
the save is failed.

Once a saving throw is failed, an intruder
cannot enter the forbidden area until the
spell ceases. The ward cannot be dispelled
by a caster of lesser level than the one who
established it. Intruders who enter by roll-
ing successful saving throws feel uneasy and
tense, despite their success.

In addition to the priest s holy symbol,
components include holy water and rare
incenses worth at least 1,000 gp per 60-foot
cube. If a password lock is desired, this also
requires the burning of rare incenses worth
at least 5,000 gp per 60-foot cube.

 

Priest Spells (6th Level)

 

Heal (Necromancy)
Reversible

Sphere: Healing

Range: Touch

Components: V, S

Duration: Permanent

Casting Time: 1 round

Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

The very potent heal spell enables the
priest to wipe away disease and injury in the
creature who receives the benefits of the
spell. It completely cures all diseases or
blindness of the recipient and heals all
points of damage suffered due to wounds or
injury. It dispels a feeblemind spell. It cures
those mental disorders caused by spells or
injury to the brain. Naturally, the effects can
be negated by later wounds, injuries, and
diseases.

The reverse, harm, infects the victim with
a disease and causes loss of all but 1d4 hit
points, if a successful touch is inflicted. For
creatures that are not affected by the heal
(or harm) spell, see the cure light wounds

spell.

Heroes   Feast (Evocation)

Sphere: Creation

Range: 10 yards

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 1 hour

Casting Time: 1 turn

Area of Effect: 1 individual /level
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the priest to bring forth
a great feast that serves as many creatures as
the priest has levels of experience. The spell
creates a magnificent table, chairs, service,
and all the necessary food and drink. The
feast takes one full hour to consume, and
the beneficial effects do not set in until after
this hour is over. Those partaking of the
feast are cured of all diseases, are immune to
poison for 12 hours, and are healed of
1d4 +4 points of damage after imbibing the
nectar-like beverage that is part of the feast.
The ambrosia-like food that is consumed is
equal to a bless spell that lasts for 12 hours.
Also, during this same period, the people
who consumed the feast are immune to fear,
hopelessness, and panic. If the feast is inter-
rupted for any reason, the spell is ruined
and all effects of the spell are negated.

The material components of the spell are
the priest s holy symbol and specially fer-
mented honey taken from the cells of bee
larvae destined for royal status.

228

 

 

Liveoak (Enchantment)

Sphere: Plant

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 day/level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: 1 oak tree
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the caster to charm a
healthy oak tree (or other type if the DM
allows) to cause it to serve as a protector.
The spell can be cast on a single tree at a
time. While a liveoak spell cast by a particu-
lar caster is in effect, he cannot cast another
such spell. The tree upon which the spell is
cast must be within 10 feet of the caster  s
dwelling place, within a place sacred to the
caster, or within 100 yards of something
that the caster wishes to guard or protect.

The liveoak spell can be cast upon a
healthy tree of small, medium, or large size,
according to desire and availability. A trig-
gering phrase of up to a maximum of one
word per level of the spellcaster is then
placed upon the targeted oak; for instance,
“Attack any persons who come near with-
out first saying ‘sacred mistletoe   ” is an 11-
word trigger phrase that could be used by a
caster of 11th level or higher casting the
spell. The liveoak spell triggers the tree into
animating as a treant of equivalent size, an
Armor Class of 0 and with two attacks per
round, but with only a 30-foot-per-round
movement rate.

Damage
per

Tree Size Height HitDice Attack
Small 12 -14    7-8 2d8
Medium _16  -19   9-10 3d6
Large 20 -23 + 11-12 4d6

A tree enchanted by this spell radiates a
magical aura (if checked for), and can be
returned to normal by a successful casting
of a dispel magic spell, or upon the desire of
the caster who enchanted it. If dispelled, the
tree takes root immediately. If released by
the caster, it tries to return to its original
location before taking root. Damage to the
tree can be healed with a plant growth spell,
which restores 3d4 points of damage. A
plant growth spell used in this fashion does
not increase the size or hit points of the
liveoak beyond the original value.

The caster needs his holy symbol to cast
this spell.
Priest Spells (6th Level)

 

Part Water (Alteration)

Sphere: Elemental (Water)
Range: 20 yards/level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

By employing a part water spell, the
priest is able to cause water or similar liquid
to move apart, thus forming a trough. The
depth and length of the trough created by
the spell depends on the level of the priest. A
trough three feet deep per caster level, by 30
yards wide, by 20 yards long per level is cre-
ated. Thus at 12th level, the priest would
part water 36 feet deep by 30 yards wide by
240 yards long. The trough remains as long
as the spell lasts or until the priest who cast
it opts to end its effects. Existing currents
appear to flow through the parted water,
although swimming creatures and physical
objects such as boats do not enter the rift
without strenuous and deliberate effort. If
cast underwater, this spell creates an air cyl-
inder of appropriate length and diameter. If
cast directly on a water elemental or other
water-based creature, the creature receives
4d8 points of damage and must roll a suc-
cessful saving throw vs. spell or flee in panic
for 3d4 rounds.

The material component of this spell is
the priest s holy symbol.

Speak With Monsters (Alteration)

Sphere: Divination
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: 2 round/level
Casting Time: 9

Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

When cast, the speak with monsters spell
enables the priest to converse with any type
of creature that has any form of communi-
cative ability (including empathic, tactile,
pheromonic, etc.). That is, the monster
understands, in its own language or equiva-
lent, the intent of what is said to it by the
priest and vice versa. The creature thus spo-
ken to is checked by your DM in order to
determine reaction. All creatures of the
same type as that chosen by the priest can
likewise understand if they are within
range. The priest can speak to different
types of creatures during the spell duration,
but he must speak separately to each type.
The spell lasts for two rounds per caster
level.

 

Stone Tell (Divination)

Sphere: Elemental (Earth), Divination
Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 1 turn

Casting Time: 1 turn

Area of Effect: 1 cubic yard of stone
Saving Throw: None

When the priest casts a stone tell spell
upon an area, the very stones speak and
relate to the caster who or what has touched
them as well as telling what is covered, con-
cealed, or simply behind them. The stones
relate complete descriptions, if asked. Note
that a stone s perspective, perception, and
knowledge may hinder this divination; such
details, if any, are decided by the DM.

The material components for this spell are
a drop of mercury and a bit of clay.

Transmute Water to Dust (Alteration)
Reversible

Sphere: Elemental (Water, Earth)
Range: 60 yards

Components: V, S, M

Duration: Permanent

Casting Time: 8

Area of Effect: 1 cubic yard/level
Saving Throw: Special

When this spell is cast, the subject area
instantly undergoes a change from liquid to
powdery dust. Note that if the water is
already muddy, the area of effect is doubled,
while if wet mud is present, the area of effect
is quadrupled. If water remains in contact
with the transmuted dust, the former quick-
ly permeates the latter, turning the dust into
silty mud, if a sufficient quantity of water
exists to do so, otherwise soaking or damp-
ening the dust accordingly.

Only the liquid actually in the area of
effect at the moment of spellcasting is affect-
ed. Potions that contain water as a compo-
nent part are rendered useless. Living
creatures are unaffected, except for those
native to the elemental plane of Water. Such
creatures must roll a successful saving
throws vs. death or be slain; however, only
one such creature can be affected by any sin-
gle casting of this spell, regardless of the
creature s size or the size of the spell  s area of
effect.

The reverse of this spell is simply a very
high-powered create water spell that
requires a pinch of normal dust as an addi-
tional material component.

For either usage of the spell, other compo-
nents required are diamond dust of at least
500 gp value, a bit of seashell, and the cast-
er  s holy symbol.

Transport Via Plants (Alteration)

Sphere: Plant

Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 4

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the caster is able to
enter any large plant (human-sized or larg-
er) and pass any distance to a plant of the
same species in a single round, regardless of
the distance, separating the two. The entry
plant must be alive. The destination plant
need not be familiar to the caster, but it also
must be alive. If the caster is uncertain of the
destination plant, he need merely determine
direction and distance, and the transport via
plants spell moves him as close as possible
to the desired location. There is a basic 20%
chance, reduced by 1% per level of experi-
ence of the caster, that the transport delivers
the caster to a similar species of plant from 1
to 100 miles away from the desired destina-
tion plant. If a particular destination plant is
desired, but the plant is not living, the spell
fails and the caster must come forth from
the entrance plant within 24 hours. Note
that this spell does not function with plant-
like creatures—e.g., shambling mounds,
treants, etc. The destruction of an occupied
plant slays the caster (see the plant door
spell).

Turn Wood (Alteration)

Sphere: Plant

Range: 0

Components: V, S

Duration: 1 round/level

Casting Time: 9

Area of Effect: 120-foot-wide path,
20 feet long/level

Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, waves of force roll
forth from the caster, moving in the direc-
tion he faces, and causing all wooden
objects in the path of the spell to be pushed
away from the caster to the limit of the area
of effect. Wooden objects above three inch-
es in diameter that are fixed firmly are not
affected, but loose objects (movable man-
tles, siege towers, etc.) move back. Objects
under three inches in diameter that are fixed
splinter and break, and the pieces move
with the wave of force. Thus, objects such
as wooden shields, spears, wooden weapon
shafts and hafts, and arrows and bolts are
pushed back, dragging those carrying them
with them. If a spear is planted in order to
prevent this forced movement, it splinters.
Even magical items with wooden sections
are turned, although an anti-magic shell
blocks the effects. A successful dispel magic
spell ends the effect. Otherwise, the turn
  

wood spell lasts for one round for each
experience level of the caster.

The waves of force continue to sweep
down the set path for the spell  s duration,
pushing back wooden objects in the area of
effect at a rate of 40 feet per melee round.
The length of the path is 20 feet per level of
the caster, thus a 14th-level caster casts a
turn wood spell with an area of effect 120
feet wide by 280 feet long, and the spell lasts
for 14 rounds. Note that after casting the
spell, the path is set and the caster can then
do other things or go elsewhere without
affecting the spell  s power.

Wall of Thorns
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Sphere: Plant, Creation

Range: 80 yards

Components: V, S

Duration: 1 turn/level

Casting Time: 9

Area of Effect: One 10-foot cube/level
Saving Throw: None

The wall of thorns spell creates a barrier of
very tough, pliable, tangled brush bearing
needle-sharp thorns as long as a person  s fin-
ger. Any creature breaking through (or
crashing into) the wall of thorns suffers 8
points of damage, plus an additional amount
of damage equal to the creature s AC. Nega-
tive ACs subtract from the base 8 points of
damage, but no adjustment is made for Dex-
terity. Any creature within the area of effect
of the spell when it is cast crashes into the
wall of thorns, and must break through to
move. The damage is based on each 10-foot
thickness of the barrier.

If the wall of thorns is chopped at, it takes
at least four turns to cut a path through a 10-
foot thickness. Normal fire cannot harm the
barrier, but magical fires burn away the bar-
rier in two turns, creating a wall of fire effect
while doing so (see wall of fire spell). In this
case, the cool side of the wall is that closest
to the caster of the thorn wall.

The nearest edge of the wall of thorns
appears up to 80 yards distant from the cast-
er, as he desires. The spell lasts for one turn
for each level of experience of the caster,
covers one 10-foot cube per level of the cast-
er in whatever shape the caster desires. Thus
a 14th-level caster could create a wall of
thorns up to 70 feet long by 20 feet high (or
deep) by 10 feet deep (or high), a 10-foot-
high by 10-foot-wide by 140-foot-long wall
to block a dungeon passage, or any other
sort of shape that suited his needs. The cast-
er can also create a wall of five-foot thick-
ness, which inflicts half damage but can be
doubled in one of the other dimensions.
Note that those with the ability to pass
through overgrown areas are not hindered
by this barrier. The caster can dismiss the
barrier on command.

Weather Summoning
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Sphere: Weather
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

By this spell, the caster calls forth weather
appropriate to the climate and season of the
area he is in at the time. Thus, in spring a
tornado, thunderstorm, cold, sleet storm,
or hot weather could be summoned. In sum-
mer a torrential rain, heat wave, hail storm,
etc., can be called for. In autumn, hot or
cold weather, fog, sleet, etc., could be sum-
moned. Winter enables great cold, blizzard,
or thaw conditions to be summoned.
Hurricane-force winds can be summoned
near coastal regions in the late winter or ear-
ly spring. The summoned weather is not
under the control of the caster. It might last
but a single turn, in the case of a tornado, or
for hours or even days in other cases. The
area of effect likewise varies from about one
square mile to 100 square miles. Note that
several casters can act in concert to greatly
affect weather, controlling winds, and
working jointly to summon very extreme
weather conditions.

Within four turns after the spell is cast,
the trend of the weather to come is
apparent—e.g., clearing skies, gusts of
warm or hot air, a chill breeze, overcast
skies, etc. Summoned weather arrives
1d12+5 turns after the spell is cast. Note
that the new weather condition cannot be
changed by the caster once it has been sum-
moned. Once the weather is fully summon-
ed, it cannot be dispelled. If the summoning
is successfully dispelled before it has been
completed, the weather slowly reverts to its
original condition.

Word of Recall (Alteration)
Sphere: Summoning

Range: 0
Components: V
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

The word of recall spell takes the priest
instantly back to his sanctuary when the
word is uttered. The sanctuary must be spe-
cifically designated in advance by the priest
and must be a well-known place. The actual
point of arrival is a designated area no larg-
er than 10   X 10  , The priest can be trans-
ported any distance, from above or below
ground. Transportation by the word of
recall spell is safe within a plane, but for
each plane the priest is removed, there is a

230

 

 

10% cumulative chance that the priest is
irrevocably lost. The priest is able to trans-
port, in addition to himself, 25 pounds of
weight per experience level. Thus, a 15th-
level priest could transport his person and
an additional 375 pounds weight. This extra
matter can be equipment, treasure, or even
living material, such as another person.
Exceeding this limit causes the spell to fail.
Note that unusually strong physical fields
(e.g., magnetic, gravitational) or magical
forces can, at the DM s option, make the use
of this spell hazardous or impossible.

 

Seventh-Level Spells

Animate Rock (Alteration)

Sphere: Elemental (Earth)
Range: 40 yards

Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1 round

Area of Effect: 2 cubic feet/level
Saving Throw: None

By employing an animate rock spell, the
caster causes a stone object of up to the indi-
cated size to move (see the 6th-level animate
object spell.) The animated stone object
must be separate (not a part of a huge boul-
der or the like). It follows the desire of the
caster—attacking, breaking objects, block-
ing—while the magic lasts. It has no intelli-
gence or volition of its own, but it follows
instructions exactly as spoken. Note that
only one set of instructions for one single
action (the whole being simply worded and
very brief—12 words or so) can be given to
the animated rock. The rock remains ani-
mated for one round per experience level of
the caster. The volume of rock that can be
animated is also based on the experience
level of the caster—two cubic feet of stone
per level—e.g., 24 cubic feet, a mass of
about man-sized, at 12th level.

While the exact details of the animated
rock are decided by the DM, its Armor
Class is no worse than 5, and it has 1d3 hit
Priest Spells (7th Level)

 

points per cubic foot of volume. It uses the
attack roll of the caster. The maximum dam-
age it can inflict is 1d2 points per caster level
(thus, a 12th-level caster  s rock might inflict
12 to 24 points of damage). Movement, for
a man-sized rock, is 60 feet per round. A
rock generally weighs from 100 to 300
pounds per cubic foot.

The material components for the spell are
a stone and drop of the caster  s blood.

Astral Spell (Alteration)

Sphere: Astral

Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: ?/2 hour
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

By means of the astral spell, a priest is
able to project his astral body into the As-
tral plane, leaving his physical body and
material possessions behind on the Prime
Material plane. As the Astral plane touches
upon the first levels of all the outer planes,
the priest can travel astrally to the first level
of any of these outer planes as he wills. The
priest then leaves the Astral plane, forming
a body on the plane of existence he has cho-
sen to enter. It is also possible to travel as-
trally anywhere in the Prime Material plane
by means of the astral spell (however, a sec-
ond body cannot be formed on the Prime
Material plane; see following).

As a general rule, a person astrally pro-
jected can be seen only by creatures on the
Astral plane. The astral body is connected
at all times to the material body by a silvery
cord, If the cord is broken, the affected per-
son is killed, astrally and materially, but
generally only the psychic wind can cause
the cord to break. When a second body is
formed on a different plane, the silvery cord
remains invisibly attached to the new body.
If the second body or astral form is slain, the
cord simply returns to the caster  s body
where the body rests on the Prime Material
plane, reviving it from its state of suspended
animation. Although astral projections are
able to function on the Astral plane, their
actions affect only creatures existing on the
Astral plane; a physical body must be mate-
rialized on other planes.

The spell lasts until the priest desires to
end it, or until it is terminated by some out-
side means (such as a dispel magic spell or
destruction of the priest s body on the Prime
Material plane [which kills the priest]). The
priest can project the astral forms of up to
seven other creatures with himself by means
of the astral spell, providing the creatures
are linked in a circle with the priest. These
fellow travelers are dependent upon the
priest and can be stranded if something hap-
pens to the priest. Travel in the Astral plane

 

can be slow or fast, according to the priest s
desire. The ultimate destination arrived at is
subject to the desire of the priest.

Changestaff (Evocation, Enchantment)

Sphere: Plant, Creation

Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special

Casting Time: 4

Area of Effect: The caster  s staff
Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the caster is able to
change a specially prepared staff into a
treant-like creature of the largest size (about
24 feet tall). When the priest plants the end
of the staff in the ground and speaks a spe-
cial command and invocation, the staff
turns into a treant-like creature with 12 Hit
Dice, 40 hit points, and Armor Class 0. It at-
tacks twice per round, inflicting 4d6 points
of damage with every successful attack. The
staff-treant defends the caster and obeys
any spoken commands. However, it is by no
means a true treant; it cannot converse with
actual treants or control trees. The transfor-
mation lasts either for as many turns as the
caster has experience levels, until the caster
commands the staff to return to its true
form, or until the staff is destroyed, which-
ever occurs first. If the staff-treant is re-
duced to 0 hit points or less, it crumbles to a
sawdust-like powder and the staff is de-
stroyed. Otherwise, the staff can be used
again after 24 hours and the staff-treant is at
full strength.

To cast a changestaff spell, the caster must
have either his holy symbol or leaves (ash,
oak, or yew) of the same sort as the staff.

The staff for the changestaff spell must be
specially prepared. The staff must be a
sound limb cut from an ash, oak, or yew
tree struck by lightning no more than 24
hours before the limb is cut. The limb must
then be cured by sun drying and special
smoke for 28 days. Then it must be shaped,
carved, and polished for another 28 days.
The caster cannot adventure or engage in
other strenuous activity during either of
these periods. The finished staff, engraved
with woodland scenes, is then rubbed with
the juice of holly berries, and the end of it is
thrust into the earth of the caster  s grove
while he casts a speak with plant spell, call-
ing upon the staff to assist in time of need.
The item is then charged with a magic that
will last for many changes from staff to
treant and back again.

Chariot Of Sustarre (Evocation)

Sphere: Elemental (Fire), Creation
Range: 10 yards

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 12 hours

Casting Time: 1 turn

Area of Effect: Special

Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, it brings forth a
large, flaming chariot pulled by two fiery
horses from the elemental plane of Fire.
These appear in a clap of thunder amid a
cloud of smoke. The vehicle moves at 24 on
the ground, 48 flying, and can carry the
caster and up to seven other creatures of
man-size or less (the passengers must be
touched by the caster to protect them from
the flames of the chariot). Creatures other
than the caster and his designated passen-
gers sustain 2d4 points of fire damage each
round if they come within five feet of the
horses or chariot. Such creatures suffer no
damage if they evade the area by rolling suc-
cessful saving throws vs. petrification, with
Dexterity adjustments.

The caster controls the chariot by verbal
command, causing the flaming steeds to
stop or go, walk, trot, run or fly, and turn
left or right as he desires. Note that the char-
iot of Sustarre is a physical manifestation
and can sustain damage. The vehicle and
steeds are struck only by magical weapons
or by water (one quart of which inflicts 1
point of damage), they are Armor Class 2,
and each requires 30 points of damage to
dispel. Naturally, fire has absolutely no ef-
fect upon either the vehicle or its steeds, but
magical fires other than those of the chariot
can affect the riders. Other spells, such as a
successful dispel magic or holy word, will
force the chariot back to its home plane,
without its passengers. The chariot can be
summoned only once per week.

The material components are a small
piece of wood, two holly berries, and a fire
source at least equal to a torch.

Confusion (Enchantment/Charm)

Sphere: Charm

Range: 80 yards

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 1 round/level

Casting Time: 1 round

Area of Effect: 1d4 creatures within
a 40   by 40  square

Saving Throw: Special

This spell causes confusion in one or more
creatures within the area, creating indeci-
sion and the inability to take effective
action. The spell affects 1d4 creatures, plus
one creature per two caster levels. Thus,
seven to ten creatures can be affected by a
12th- or 13th-level caster, eight to 11 by a
14th- or 15th-level caster, etc. These crea-
  

tures are allowed saving throws vs. spell
with —2 penalties, adjusted for Wisdom.
Those successfully saving are unaffected by
the spell. Confused creatures react as fol-
lows (roll 1d10):

Dio
Roll Reaction
1 Wander away (unless prevented) for
duration of spell
2-6 Stand confused one round
(then roll again)
7-9 Attack nearest creature for one round
(then roll again)
10 Act normally for one round
(then roll again)

The spell lasts one round for each level of
the caster. Those who fail their saving
throws are checked by the DM for actions
each round, for the duration of the spell, or
until the “wander away for the duration of
the spell” result occurs.

Wandering creatures move as far from the
caster as possible in their most typical mode
of movement (characters walk, fish swim,
bats fly, etc.). This is not panicked flight.
Wandering creatures also have a 50%
chance of using any special innate move-
ment abilities (plane shift, burrowing,
flight, etc.). Saving throws and actions are
checked at the beginning of each round.
Any confused creature that is attacked per-
ceives the attacker as an enemy and acts
according to its basic nature.

The material component of this spell is a
set of three nut shells.

Note: If there are many creatures
involved, the DM may decide to assume
average results. For example, if there are 16
orcs affected and 25% could be expected to
successfully roll the saving throw, then four
are assumed to have succeeded, one wan-
ders away, four attack the nearest creature,
six stand confused and the last acts normal-
ly but must check next round. Since the orcs
are not near the party, the DM decides that
two who are supposed to attack the nearest
creature attack each other, one attacks an
orc that saved, and one attacks a confused
orc, which strikes back. The next round, the
base is 11 orcs, since four originally saved
and one wandered off. Another one wan-
ders off, five stands confused, four attack,
and one acts normally.

 

Priest Spells (7th Level)

 

Conjure Earth Elemental
(Conjuration/Summoning)
Reversible

Sphere: Elemental (Earth), Summoning
Range: 40 yards

Components: V, S

Duration: 1 turn/level

Casting Time: 1 turn

Area of Effect: Special

Saving Throw: None

A caster who performs a conjure earth
elemental spell summons an earth elemental
to do his bidding. The elemental is 60%
likely to have 12 Hit Dice, 35% likely to
have 16 Hit Dice, and 5% likely have 21 to
to 24 Hit Dice (20 + 1d4). Furthermore, the
caster needs but to command it, and it does
as desired, for the elemental regards the
caster as a friend to be obeyed. The elemen-
tal remains until destroyed, dispelled, sent
away by dismissal or a holy word spell (see
the conjure fire elemental spell), or the spell
duration expires.

Control Weather (Alteration)

Sphere: Weather

Range: 0

Components: V, S, M
Duration: 4d12 hours

Casting Time: 1 turn

Area of Effect: 4d4 square miles
Saving Throw: None

The control weather spell enables a priest
to change the weather in the local area. The
spell affects the weather for 4d12 hours in an
area of 4d4 square miles. It requires one turn
to cast the spell, and an additional 1d4 turns
for the effects of the spell to be felt. The cur-
rent weather conditions are decided by the
DM, depending on the climate and season.
Weather conditions have three components:
precipitation, temperature, and wind. The
spell can change these conditions according

 

 
 

The upper-case headings represent exist-
ing weather conditions. The lower-case
headings below each upper-case heading are
the new conditions to which the caster can
change the existing conditions. Further-
more, the caster can control the direction of
the wind. For example, a day that is clear,
warm, and with moderate wind can be con-
trolled to become hazy, hot, and calm. Con-
tradictions are not possible—fog and strong
wind, for example. Multiple control weath-
er spells can be used only in succession.

The material components for this spell are
the priest s religious symbol, incense, and
prayer beads or similar prayer object. Obvi-
ously, this spell functions only in areas
where there are appropriate climatic condi-
tions.

If Weather is a major sphere for the priest
(as it is for druids), duration and area are
doubled, and the caster can change the pre-
vailing weather by two places (e.g., he can
cause precipitation to go from partly cloudy
to heavy sleet, temperature to go from cool
to arctic, and wind to go from calm to
strong).

Creeping Doom
(Conjuration/Summoning)
Sphere: Animal, Summoning
Range: 0

Components: V, S

Duration: 4 rounds/level
Casting Time: 1 round

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

When the caster utters the spell of creep-
ing doom, he calls forth a mass of from 500
to 1,000 ([1d6 +4] x 100) venomous, biting
and stinging arachnids, insects, and myria-
pods, This carpet-like mass swarms in an
area 20 feet square. Upon command from
the caster, the swarm creeps forth at 10 feet
per round toward any prey within 80 yards,

 

to the following chart: moving in the direction in which the caster

commands. The creeping doom slays any
creature subject to normal attacks, as each
of the small horrors inflicts 1 point of dam-
age (each then dies after its attack), so that
up to 1,000 points of damage can be in-
flicted on creatures within the path of the
creeping doom. If the creeping doom goes
more than 80 yards away from the sum-
moner, it loses 50 of its number for each 10
yards beyond 80 yards (e.g., at 100 yards,
its number has shrunk by 100). There are a
number of ways to thwart or destroy the
creatures forming the swarm. The solutions
are left to the imaginations of players and
DMs.

Earthquake (Alteration)

Sphere: Elemental (Earth)

Range: 120 yards

Components: V, S, M

Duration: 1 round

Casting Time: 1 turn

Area of Effect: 5-foot diameter/level
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast by a priest, a local
tremor of fairly high strength rips the
ground. The shock is over in one round.
The earthquake affects all terrain, vegeta-
tion, structures, and creatures in its area of
effect. The area of effect of the earthquake
spell is circular, with a diameter of five feet
for every experience level of the priest cast-
ing it. Thus a 20th-level priest casts an
earthquake spell with a 100-foot-diameter
area of effect.

Solidly built structures with foundations
reaching down to bedrock sustain one-half
damage; one-quarter damage if they score
above 50% ona saving throw. An earth ele-
mental opposed to the caster in the area of
effect can negate 10% to 100% (roll 1d10,
0 = 100% ) of the effect. Other magical
protections and wards allowed by the DM
may also reduce or negate this effect. If cast
undersea, this spell may, at the discretion of
the DM, create a tsunami or tidal wave.

The material components for this spell are
a pinch of dirt, a piece of rock, and a lump
of clay.

Exaction (Evocation, Alteration)

Sphere: Charm, Summoning
Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special

Casting Time: 1 round

Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is employed, the priest
confronts some powerful creature from an-
other plane (including devas and other pow-
erful minions, for instance, but not
demigods or deities of any sort) and requires
of it some duty or quest. A creature of an
alignment opposed to the priest (e.g., evil if
the priest is good, chaotic if the priest is law-
ful) cannot be ordered around unless it is
willing. Note that an absolute (true) neutral
creature is effectively opposed to both good
and evil, and both law and chaos.

CREATURES

See “TERRAIN” entry

233

 

The spellcaster must know something
about the creature to exact service from it,
or else he must offer some fair trade in re-
turn for the service. That is, if the priest is
aware that the creature has received some
favor from someone of the priest s align-
ment, then the exaction spell can name this
as cause; if no balancing reason for service is
known, then some valuable gift or service
must be pledged in return for the exaction.
The service exacted must be reasonable with
respect to the past or promised favor or re-
ward, and with the being  s effort and risk.
The spell then acts, subject to a magic resist-
ance roll, as a quest upon the being that is to
perform the required service. Immediately
upon completion of the service, the being is
transported to the vicinity of the priest, and
the priest must then and there return the
promised reward, whether it is irrevocable
cancellation of a past debt or the giving of
some service or other material reward. Af-
ter this is done, the creature is instantly
freed to return to its own plane.

The DM adjudicates when an equitable
arrangement has been reached. If the caster
requests too much, the creature is free to de-
part or to attack the priest (as if the agree-
ment were breached) according to its
nature. If circumstances leave the situation
unbalanced (for example, the creature dies
while achieving a result that was not worth
the creature dying), then this might create a
debt owed by the caster to the creature s sur-
viving kith and kin, making the caster vul-
nerable to a future exaction from that
quarter. Agreeing to a future exaction or re-
lease in the event of catastrophic failure or
death are common caster pledges in securing
an exaction.

Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter
results in the priest being subject to exaction
by the subject creature or by its master,
liege, etc., at the very least. At worst, the
creature may attack the reneging priest
without fear of any of his spells affecting it,
for the priest s failure to live up to the bar-
gain gives the creature total immunity from
the priest s spell powers.

The material components of this spell are
the priest  s holy symbol, some matter or
substance from the plane of the creature
from whom an exaction is expected, and
knowledge of the creature s nature or
actions that is written out on a parchment
that is burned to seal the pledge.
Priest Spells (7th Level)

 

Fire Storm (Evocation)
Reversible

Sphere: Elemental (Fire)

Range: 160 yards

Components: V, S

Duration: 1 round

Casting Time: 1 round

Area of Effect: 20-foot cube/level, mini-
mum 16 10-foot cubes

Saving Throw: */2

When a fire storm spell is cast, the whole
area is shot through with sheets of roaring
flame that equal a wall of fire spell in effect.
Creatures within the area of fire and 10 feet
or less from the edge of the affected area
receive 2d8 points of damage plus addition-
al damage equal to the caster  s level (2d8 +
1/level). Creatures that roll successful sav-
ing throws vs. spell suffer only one-half
damage. The damage is inflicted each round
the creature stays in the area of effect. The
area of effect is equal to two 10   x 10   cubes
per level of the caster—e.g., a 13th-level
caster can cast a fire storm measuring 130   x
20  x 10  . The height of the storm is 10 or 20
feet; the balance of its area must be in length
and width.

The reverse spell, fire quench, smothers
twice the area of effect of a fire storm with
respect to normal fires, and the normal area
of effect with respect to magical fires. Fire-
based creatures, such as elementals, sala-
manders, etc., of less than demigod status
have a a 5% chance per experience level of
the caster of being extinguished. If cast only
against a flametongue sword, the sword
must roll a successful saving throw vs.
crushing blow or be rendered nonmagical.
Such a sword in the possession of a creature
first receives the creature s saving throw,
and if this is successful, the second saving
throw is automatically successful.

Gate (Conjuration/Summoning)

Sphere: Summoning
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Casting a gate spell has two effects: it
causes an interdimensional connection
between the plane of existence the priest is in
and the plane in which dwells a specific
being of great power. The result of this con-
nection is that the sought-after being can
step through the gate or portal, from its
plane to that of the priest. Uttering the spell
attracts the attention of the dweller on the
other plane. When casting the spell, the
priest must name the entity he desires to
make use of the gate and to come to his aid.

 

There is a 100% chance that something
steps through the gate. The actions of the
being that comes through depend on many
factors, including the alignment of the
priest, the nature of those accompanying
him, and who or what opposes or threatens
the priest. Your DM will decide the exact
result of the spell, based on the creature
called, the desires of the caster and the needs
of the moment. The being gated in either
returns immediately or remains to take
action. Casting this spell ages the priest five
years.

Holy Word (Conjuration/Summoning)
Reversible

Sphere: Combat

Range: 0

Components: V

Duration: Special

Casting Time: 1

Area of Effect: 30-foot radius
Saving Throw: None

Uttering a holy word spell creates magic
of tremendous power. It drives off evil crea-
tures from other planes, forcing them to
return to their own planes of existence, pro-
vided the speaker is in his home plane. Crea-
tures so banished cannot return for at least a
day. The spell further affects creatures of
differing alignment as shown on the follow-
ing table:

 

Regenerate (Necromancy)
Reversible

Sphere: Necromantic

Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M

Duration: Permanent

Casting Time: 3 rounds

Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

When a regenerate spell is cast, body
members (fingers, toes, hands, feet, arms,
legs, tails, or even the heads of multi-headed
creatures), bones, and organs grow back.
The process of regeneration requires but one
round if the severed member(s) is (are)
present and touching the creature, 2d4 turns
otherwise. The creature must be living to
receive the benefits of this spell. If the sev-
ered member is not present, or if the injury
is older than one day per caster level, the
recipient must roll a successful system shock
check to survive the spell.

The reverse, wither, causes the member
or organ touched to shrivel and cease func-
tioning in one round, dropping off into dust
in 2d4 turns. Creatures must be touched for
the harmful effect to occur.

The material components of this spell are
a prayer device and holy water (or unholy
water for the reverse).

 

Effects of Holy Word

* Slowed creatures attack only on even-numbered rounds until the effect wears off.

 

Affected creatures are those within the
30-foot-radius area of effect, which is cen-
tered on the priest casting the spell. The side
effects are negated for deafened or silenced
creatures, but such are still driven off if
other-planar.

The reverse, unholy word, operates
exactly the same way but affects creatures
of good alignment.

Reincarnate (Necromancy)

Sphere: Necromantic

Range: Touch

Components: V, S

Duration: Permanent

Casting Time: 1 turn

Area of Effect: Person touched
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the priest can bring back a
dead person in another body, if death
occurred no more than one week before the
casting of the spell. Reincarnation does not
require any saving throw, system shock, or
resurrection survival roll. The corpse is
touched, and a new incarnation of the per-
son appears in the area in 1d6 turns. The
person reincarnated recalls the majority of
his former life and form, but the character
class, if any, of the new incarnation might
Priest Spells (7th Level)

 

be very different indeed. The new incarna-
tion is determined on the following table or
by DM choice. If a player character race is
indicated, the character must be created. At
the DM s option, certain special (expensive)
incenses can be used that may increase the
chance for a character to return as a specific
race or species. A wish spell can restore a
reincarnated character to its original form
and status.

D100

Roll Incarnation
01-03 Badger
04-08 Bear, black
09-12 Bear, brown
17-19 Centaur
20-23 Dryad
24-28 Eagle

29-31 Elf

32-34 Faun/satyr

45-58 Human
59-61 Lynx

62-64 Owl

71-75 Stag

76-80 Wolf

81-85 Wolverine
86-00 DM s choice

If an unusual creature form is indicated,
the DM can (at his option only) use the
guidelines for new player character races to
allow the character to earn experience and
advance in levels, although this may not be
in the same class as before. If the reincarnat-
ed character returns as a creature eligible to
be the same class as he was previously (i.e.,
a human fighter returns as an elf), the rein-
carnated character has half his previous
levels and hit points. If the character returns
as a new character class, his hit points are
half his previous total, but he must begin
again at 1st level. If the character returns as
a creature unable to have a class, he has half
the hit points and saving throws of his pre-
vious incarnation.

Restoration (Necromancy)
Reversible

Sphere: Necromantic

Range: Touch

Components: V, S

Duration: Permanent

Casting Time: 3 rounds

Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the life energy
level of the recipient creature is raised by
one. This reverses any previous life energy
level drain of the creature by a force or mon-

 

ster. Thus, if a 10th-level character had been
struck by a wight and drained to 9th level,
the restoration spell would bring the charac-
ter up to exactly the number of experience
points necessary to restore him to 10th level
once again, restoring additional Hit Dice (or
hit points) and level functions accordingly.
Restoration is effective only if the spell is
cast within one day of the recipient s loss of
life energy, per experience level of the priest
casting it. A restoration spell restores the
intelligence of a creature affected by a
feeblemind spell. It also negates all forms of
insanity. Casting this spell ages both the
caster and the recipient by two years.

The reverse, energy drain, draws away
one life energy level (see such undead as
spectre, wight, and vampire, in the Mon-
strous Compendium). The energy drain
requires the victim to be touched. Casting
this form of the spell does not age the caster.

Resurrection (Necromancy)
Reversible

Sphere: Necromantic

Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M

Duration: Permanent

Casting Time: 1 turn

Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

The priest employing this spell is able to
restore life and complete strength to any living
creature, including elves, he bestows the resur-
rection spell upon. The creature can have been
dead up to 10 years per level of the priest cast-
ing the spell. Thus a 19th-level priest can res-
urrect the bones of a creature dead up to 190
years. The creature, upon surviving a resur-
rection survival check, is immediately
restored to full hit points and can perform
strenuous activity. The spell cannot bring back
a creature that has reached its allotted life span
(i.e., died of natural causes). Casting this spell
makes it impossible for the priest to cast fur-
ther spells or engage in combat until he has
had one day of bed rest for each experience
level or Hit Die of the creature brought back
to life. The caster ages three years upon cast-

The reverse, destruction, causes the vic-
tim of the spell to be instantly dead and
turned to dust. A wish spell or equivalent is
required for recovery. Destruction requires
a touch, either in combat or otherwise, and
does not age the caster. In addition, the vic-
tim is allowed a saving throw (with a —4
penalty). If the save is successful, the victim
receives 8d6 points of damage instead.

The material components of the spell are
the priest s religious symbol and holy water
(unholy water for the reverse spell). The
DM may reduce the chances of successful
resurrection if little of the creature s remains
are available.

Succor (Alteration, Enchantment)
Reversible

Sphere: Summoning
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 day
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

By casting this spell, the priest creates a
powerful magic in some specially prepared
object—a string of prayer beads, a small
clay tablet, an ivory baton, etc. This object
radiates magic, for it contains the power to
instantaneously transport its possessor to
the sanctuary of the priest who created its
magic. Once the item is enchanted, the
priest must give it willingly to an individual,
at the same time informing him of a com-
mand word to be spoken when the item is to
be used. To make use of the item, the recipi-
ent must speak the command word at the
same time that he rends or breaks the item.
When this is done, the individual and all
that he is wearing and carrying (up to the
maximum encumbrance limit for the char-
acter) are instantly transported to the sanc-
tuary of the priest, just as if the individual
were capable of speaking a word of recall
spell. No other creatures can be affected.

The reversed application of the spell
causes the priest to be transported to the
immediate vicinity of the possessor of the
item when it is broken and the command
word said, The priest has a general idea of
the location and situation of the item s pos-
sessor, and can choose not to be affected by
this summons. This decision is made at the
instant when the transportation is to take
place, but if he chooses not to go, then the
opportunity is gone forever and the spell is
wasted.

The cost of preparing the special item (for
either version of the spell) varies from 2,000
to 5,000 gp. The more costly items can
transport the subject from one plane of
existence to another, if the DM allows. Note
that the same factors that can prevent the
operation of the plane shift and teleport
spells can also prevent the use of this spell.

Sunray (Evocation, Alteration)

Sphere: Sun
Range: 10 yards/level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 + 1d4 rounds
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 5-foot-radius sphere
(plus special)

Saving Throw: Special

With this spell, the caster can evoke a
dazzling beam of light each round in which
no action other than movement is per-
formed. The sunray is like a ray of natural
Priest Spells (7th Level)

 

sunlight. All creatures in the 10-foot-
diameter area of effect must roll successful
saving throws vs. spell or be blinded for 1d3
rounds, those using infravision at the time
for 2d4 rounds. Creatures to whom sunlight
is harmful or unnatural suffer permanent
blindness if the saving throw is failed, and
are blinded for 2d6 rounds if the saving
throw is successful. Those within its area of
effect, as well as creatures within 20 feet of
its perimeter, lose any infravision capabili-
ties for 1d4 +1 rounds.

Undead caught within the sunray  s area of
effect receive 8d6 points of damage, one-
half if a saving throw vs. spell is successful.
Those undead 20 feet to either side of the
sunray  s area of effect receive 3d6 points of
damage, no damage if a save is successful.
In addition, the ray may result in the total
destruction of those undead specifically af-
fected by sunlight, if their saving throws are
failed. The ultraviolet light generated by the
spell inflicts damage on fungoid creatures
and subterranean fungi just as if they were
undead, but no saving throw is allowed.

The material components are an aster
seed and a piece of aventurine feldspar (sun-
stone).

Symbol (Conjuration/Summoning)

Sphere: Guardian
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 3

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Neg,

The priest casting this spell inscribes a
glowing symbol in the air or upon any sur-
face, according to his desire. Any creature
looking at the completed symbol within 60
feet must roll a successful saving throw vs.
spell or suffer the effect. The symbol glows
for one turn for each experience level of the
caster. The particular symbol used is se-
lected by the caster at the time of casting.
The caster will not be affected by his own
symbol. One of the following effects is cho-
sen by the caster:

Hopelessness: Creatures seeing it must turn
back in dejection or surrender to capture
or attack unless they roll successful sav-
ing throws vs. spell. Its effects last for
3d4 turns.

Pain; Creatures affected suffer —4 penalties
to their attack rolls and —2 penalties to
their Dexterity ability scores due to
wracking pains. The effects last for 2d10
turns.

Persuasion: Creatures seeing the symbol be-
come of the same alignment as and
friendly to the priest who scribed the
symbol for 1d20 turns unless a saving
throw vs. spell is successful.

 

The material components of this spell are
mercury and phosphorus (see 8th-level wiz-
ard spell, symbol).

Transmute Metal to Wood (Alteration)

Sphere: Elemental (Earth)
Range: 80 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 round

Area of Effect: 1 metal object
Saving Throw: Special

The transmute metal to wood spell en-
ables the caster to change an object from
metal to wood. The volume of metal cannot
exceed a maximum weight of 10 pounds per
experience level of the priest. Magical ob-
jects made of metal are 90% resistant to the
spell, and those on the person of a creature
receive the creatures saving throw as well.
Artifacts and relics cannot be transmuted.
Note that only a wish spell or similar magic
can restore a transmuted object to its metal-
lic state. Otherwise, for example, a metal
door changed to wood would be forever-
more a wooden door.

236

 

Wind Walk (Alteration)

Sphere: Elemental (Air)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 hour/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the priest, and possibly
one or two other persons, to alter the sub-
stance of his body to a cloud-like vapor. A
magical wind then wafts the priest along at a
movement rate of 60, or as slow as 6, as the
spellcaster wills. The wind walk spell lasts
as long as the priest desires, up to a maxi-
mum duration of six turns (one hour) per ex-
perience level of the caster. For every 8
levels of experience the priest has attained,
up to 24, he is able to touch another person
and carry that person, or those persons,
along on the wind walk. Persons wind
walking are not invisible, but rather appear
misty and translucent. If fully clothed in
white, they are 80% likely to be mistaken
for clouds, fog, vapors, etc. The priest can
regain his physical form as desired, each
change to and from vaporous form requir-
ing five rounds. While in vaporous form,
the priest and companions are hit only by
magic or magical weaponry, though they
may be subject to high winds at the DM s
discretion. No spellcasting is possible in va-
porous form.

The material components of this spell are
fire and holy water.
